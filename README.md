# AnalyticsDemos
This repo contains some demos of applied analytics and data science. Some are in R and some are in Python. 
Here are a few notes for usage:

1. For the Python-based demos, Anaconda Python is recommended since many analytics-based libraries
come set up. It is available here: [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

2. For the R-based demos, you will need to make sure the libraries used are installed. You can
determine which libraries you need by looking at the top of the code.
