If you are on the email list  you will get an email a little before your birthday  which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza!   This essentially gets you a large one topping  or a large white with garlic  and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!  I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens  which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end  but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing  with chunks of garlic hiding in there!  Service was pretty slow during lunchtime at the bar.  They only had one server for the entire bar area  AND she had tables in the dining area.  Not a huge deal to me since I wasn't in a hurry that day  but keep it in mind in case this wasn't an off day for them.  I'll be back at some point  but for sure next year for my birthday!"

I was a bit confused when I arrived and no one was at the front desk.  But was soon seated.  The interior is nice & modern looking  but unfortunately this may be where the nice things end.  My idea of a pizza buffet: Unlimited supply of pizza that you stand up and get on your own. Al's idea of a pizza buffet: Your choice of unlimited slices of pizza  ordered 3 at a time using a order form that you have to give to your waitress.  To start out with  I ordered a slice of silcilian pizza  a slice of pepperoni and a slice of buffalo chicken.  I liked the buffalo chicken after I dusted off the carrot slices (there were carrot slices on my buffalo chicken pizza)  and the silcillian was good but I just didn't like the sauce that was used on the pepperoni pizza.  It was now time to order more pizza  so I had to flag down my waitress  ask for an order form  order more pizza and wait for it to be delivered.  Just an odd concept to me.  I don't think I'll be returning.  Luisa's pizza buffet is more my style."

Everything here was perfect -- the decor  the service  and of course  the food!  First of all  the decor is very classy -- fancy yet inviting.  Secondly  the service was excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive and patient  answering all of my questions and letting us take our time ordering without rushing us at all.  And at the end he even surprised my mom with a birthday dessert!  And finally  the food! Yes  the food... Every dish we ordered tasted so good. Every dish was so pretty  so delicate  and tasted so yummy.  Here's what we ordered:  --Tuna-raspberry skewer: almost too pretty to eat!  But each bite is burst with flavor! --Stuffed dates: sooo good.  Just the right mix of sweetness and savoriness. And the cheese was blended perfectly with the dates along with the crispy texture of pancetta... Wow  one of the best I've had! --White ceviche: Wow  the ceviche comes with taro chips!  TARO chips! That was a every pleasant surprise! I love taros!  The fish was fresh and light with just the right amount of tartness.. --Fried calamari: Very crispy but with the perfect amount of batter.  Tasted so light yet so flavorful. --Pan tomate: Simple dish yet nice blend of toasted bread with tomato sauce and garlic season.. yum! --Red sangria: One of the best I've had  although I am not much of a drinker :P  --And the complementary birthday dessert! Santiago's Cake:  The subtle nutty flavor of the almond cake and turron ice cream -- OMG sooo good!  And we thought we had no room for dessert! It was too good not to finish... :)  Like I said  it was a perfect meal! I would definitely come here again the next time I am in Vegas!"

But I think I like downtown more than the strip. I know  I know. I sound like a hipster. Oh well!   I love the juxtaposition of the new with the old: the old facades of what used to be the main Vegas strip  connected by the modern canopy. Downtown is easier to Casino and/or bar hop  food is cheaper  it's more casual  people-watching is more interesting and there's always something going on - plenty of free entertainment while walking around under the canopy of the Freemont Street Experience.   The canopy is really cool. It's basically a giant screen that displays lights/images/graphics/video. The music is loud but it's only annoying if you are in a horrible mood or just super up tight.

Who knew Vegas was so conservative!   My husband and I came to Marquee specifically for the toptional aspect. I don't get a chance to go topless often  so this was a major draw. When we got there we were told that unless we wanted to sit at the bar we would have to pay a food and beverage minimum  $100 for 2 chairs up to $1000 for a cabana complete with it's own infinity pool.   Since we planned on spending the day there  we opted for 2 chairs. Most pitchers of mixed drinks were $75  (up to $150) steep but good. I have to say if you're going to do that  the Margarita is the most potent  choose wisely :)  The day we went was a Tuesday  so no cover  which was nice  but not many people were there. My top was the only one off all day  and I was only allowed to stay that way on my daybed. I had to put it back on to get in the pool or go to the bar...

"RW8o0pjWZ-oVFkUmDvWXrw","YMYcDXuTYrkhawrTp-cv0g",-0.0358851674641,1,"This  place is very efficient at extracting money from customers.  The first thing that irritated me is that they wanted $84 for an hour's labor to diagonse why one of the back doors wouldn't open from the outside.  (Any repairs would cost extra.  They failed me on my safety inspection  so I had to get the door fixed.) I asked them if there was any chance that the bill would be less than $84 if were to take less than an hour to diagnose.  I was told that the minimum labor charge would be for an hour  and that it would not be less.  I told the repair guy that I would only consider returning to Canadian tire if it took me more than 5 minutes to diagnose the problem myself.  As expected  by popping of the rear door panel I was able to find the problem in about 4 minutes!    The true hourly rate would have been much more than $84!  Furthermore  that particular car (a 94 volvo) has about one failure mode for the door handle (a flimsy connector joining the door handle to a metal rod going down to the lock): A mechanic experienced with Volvos would have immediately had a good idea what the problem was without looking. I ordered a used door handle from a toronto parts shop and screwed it on myself.  I was also dismayed that they failed me on my nitrous oxide emissions (which were 50% above the allowed limit) and wanted $100 to diagnose the problem to determine whether my old volvo with 65K miles on it was worth repairing.   I asked them if they had heated up the engine before running the test  and they said it was at normal operating temperature.  Not willing to take their word for it after their attempted fast one on the door lock  I took the car for a 10-minute warm up on the freeway and went to another emissions inspection station.  This time it sweaked by  no need to pay $100 to find out  what expensive repairs Canadian tire might want.  (BTW  I found out that the reason I have nitrous oxide emissions is because I don't drive my car very much.)  I have no plans to return to Canadian tire  so there will be no future updates to this review.  (Admittedly  it   will always be based on only 1 trip to Canadian tire  but I think that they are to blame for that.)"

They are giving out coupons which is pretty neat because I got 2 free chicken pieces and a drink when I ordered a 3 piece meal. The chicken was crunchy and tasted better than KFC. I also ordered the chicken wrap which has a chicken tender wrapped with a corn tortilla and comes with a little bit beans and rice in the inside. Overall  the food was not too oily and is great for a quick snack or lunch."

I wasn't impressed with the seating and the service.  That was about two years ago. My sister and I decided to try it again.  I'm so thankful I tried it again.  This time we sat over to the right when we went in.  It's funny because we were sitting at the bar (our favorite place of all areas of a restaurant).  We thought we were looking at a mirror and then we realized we were looking at the other side of the bar that was outside.  We had to laugh.  I guess because I've always been seated at a table I didn't care for the place.  Now that I was at my prime spot it felt different.  We ended up ordering the Brussel sprout salad that was so amazing that I have worked in my kitchen to reproduce the salad.  I now have it down pat  but I'm now a huge fan of Chelsea's Kitchen that I will be back again  but nobody puts baby in a corner and I will be sitting at that bar where I should have been all along.

Everyone seemed to want to hit up the buffet which is expected in Vegas.  There was a prefixed Christmas dinner which wasn't bad. It came with a choice of salad/soup  prime rib n shrimp  and choice of strawberry shortcake/pecan pie.   Our server took awhile to get to us but we didn't mind it since their menu was huge.  I had their prefixed menu and the prime rib was good and big.  The meat was juicy and shrimp was good but it had this green sauce on it that kind of threw us off but wasn't bad.  The strawberry shortcake was delicious and served with ice cream.  The server who served us was sick and had mentioned it but I found it a little disturbing as he is serving food. Not to mention I am pregnant. We had to wait awhile for our refills which he forgot half of the table.  He was nice though.  I would definitely come back for the shortcake."
"o4jOM6Mss_8i3C2iLiuFzQ","If70A2eUG6e1fe1QCHBeJg",-0.0151975683891,3,"The good:  If you go on an off time (early early or late late) its not busy.   Its not loud like many other gyms.   Its less than 2 minutes from home for me.   People mostly keep to themselves.   Their is a good array of equipment.   I once saw Rick Harrison there from Pawn Stars.  The bad:   I had a 2 year contract.. with two memberships paying about $42 a month for both. I loved it then  it was NEVER busy. I overlooked other issue that will be described later because I could get it and get out. Then came the $10 month-to-month deal.. it was always packed during hours that aren't early or late  even weekends. This was a bit annoying because I am paying twice as much (I didn't use the classes) as others who are now crowding this tiny gym beyond use. I just don't roll that way  waiting forever to use equipment. To avoid this I go at 6am and also do not use Golds Gym any longer.   No one re-racks their weights. Its a mess in there. Dumbbells are out of order or missing  plates all over the floor at the squat rack.   Some thing are quite outdated like the TVs - not a concern of mine  but maybe others.   No wifi  I would expect any modern gym to offer wifi. I like to stream Spotify or Pandora for workouts.   Horrible music- bring headphones.   Weight area is wayyyyyy too dark. Makes you feel tired. The light quality is sort of fuzzy. It makes the grey equipment look green and unappealing  but you can still get the job done.    The overall: Not my first choice of places to workout. If you go early  its not bad. Everything you need to get the job done is there. It simply lacks the quality amenities of other gyms  but also doesnt come with the typical things of other gyms like night club level music."

I mean sure I've been to restaurants and bars featuring this type of theme  but at a coffee or tea shop? It just seems different...and unique.   The boba babes here or so they're called  are friendly and will usually sit and have a conversation with your table for a while. First time here? Ask them to recommend their favorite drink. Here alone? Play a game with them! There are plenty of card and board games to choose from. They also have free wi-fi avaiable in case you brought your iPad or laptop to get some work done.  Looking for Tony T? Well you came to the right place!   Been here a couple times now since they've opened and I love their milk teas and boba drinks! Everything has good flavor and tastes fresh  and doesn't taste like it was made from artificial powders and additives like most other places in Chinatown. My favorite so far is the taro w/ boba  which you can get both hot or cold. The boba is perfecty cooked and is nice and chewy. This is probably the only tea shop where I make sure to finish all my boba instead of tossing whats left at the bottom of the cup.

Woke up around midnight to the loudest music I have ever heard in my life which lasted until past 3am. I understand its Vegas but during the week there are thousands of visitors who are here on business and its not exactly the kind of night you want to have when you need to get up early the next morning.

My cousin (sweety) was in  the mood for Thai  and on this stormy night  it was close to where we live. A cute little place in a non-descript stripmall  The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the heat. As in temperature...nothing gets the meal off to a bad start when you can't dine in comfort. Even though I'm hot (lol)  I ordered the Tom Yum soup. for 4.25 its a big bowl with 2 shrimp swimming in a zesty  SPICY broth. I ordered the soup Med-hot and that was plenty hot. YUM!  After sipping the soup  our server took requests for dinner  we started with another appetizer: Larb. The flavor was very good  just the right amount of mint and other secret spices....but the mountain of lettuce it is served on was perplexing. Every Thai restaurant I've been to serves Larb with Iettuce leaves  so one can make it a wrap  this was a nice twist on the presentation  but I prefer the more traditional style.    Here is one of my pet peeves at a restaurant....Why  for the love of God do servers find it necessary to bring out the appetizers followed immediately by the main course???? By the time I'm finished  the main entree is cold! Common sense  folks!  The green curry was the best dish of the meal  fully of artery blocking coconut milk  this baby had ooomph!  Hot  savory  filled with tender beef and lots of veggies!  The pad thai was average at best  I sensed no love in this dish  just a pile of noodles...no distinct veggies  no crunchy peanuts on the top...no scallions either. The taste was better than the looks  I'd give it a C+ if i was forced to grade.  Good news is that they are open until 9 and take plastic  bad news; no beer/wine is served. We brought our own sensing that we would be out of luck in the beer/wine dept and were told we were not allowed to drink it as they don't have a BYO license. I didn't know there was such a thing. Phoenix is nothing like Chicago as for as a preponderance of BYOs. I wish it were. Oh well that is another discussion for another day.  The service was efficient  too efficient in my opinion.  I would definitely come back  but ONLY for take out  where in can eat at my own pace  have a beer with dinner  and dine in the air-conditioned comfort of my own home.  There are other Thai restaurants in the area  I'm anxious to compare."

Today I ordered the special which was a chimichanga and drink for $6.99. Not bad except for the fact I got the wrong chimichanga. I got chicken instead the beef chimichanga I ordered.  I also ordered the rolled tacos which is an order of 3 taquitos for $5.25.  If the food were of gourmet quality I could easily see paying that but for the quality  the amount served should be twice that.  The rolled tacos are OK just way over-priced.  I'd really like to give this place one more try which is something that I never due after two really mediocre experiences.  They do serve beer and wine so it might just be a nice place to relax and have some chips and salsa.  I've only been during lunch when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Maybe the cool crowd hangs here during the evenings. Who knows?  We'll see."

I found out after I ordered by looking closely at the menu...if I knew  I would have spent less than that at starbucks for better coffee). They bring you a carafe that I'm assuming can be shared by multiple people because it's refillable but who wants a refill of burnt sand? Not me. I thought they'd charge $3.50 per carafe but no  they charge per mug. We ended up paying $7.00 for coffee that was so disgusting we had to ask for a pitcher of HOT WATER to dilute it and the waitress asked  Oh  is it for the coffee? Uh... wow. she KNEW. I bet sooo many other people asked for water to dilute their horrible coffee. I can tell you this much. that nasty coffee was the last thing i consumed in Vegas and it woke the hell out of me. I guess it did its job in a fraction of the usual sips I need (too bad i drink coffee for the taste and not so much for the kick start).  If you are going to eat breakfast  please people. go to bouchon. you won't regret it. get the sausage there. it's sooooo soft and delicious. the french toast is like bread pudding and the ham/cheese/egg sandwich is killer. the mimosa is bomb  too. since i can't give this place zero stars  might as well recommend a better choice (so my job is done).  for late night eatery  i guess you have no choice but to come here. stay away from the coffee.

What is special  like the other reviewers point out  is the venue. Set in a former church  the owners were wise in leaving the stained glass in place and in turning the alter into the location of a micro-brewery. And the brew is definitely worth it. They have a selection of staples that are all quite tasty and also rotate some seasonals in. I forget the one I tried  but it was delicious...and I'm not even a big beer drinking.

In my opinions  you can get much better food/values dining else where  i.e.  not in the casinos.    This was an over due review as it was part of my birthday offer (along with $$$ slot credits) from Venetian/Palazzo back in March.  I used it twice so I had dinner here twice.  I agree with some of the reviewers that the price is high for what you get (thus  why I don't eat in the casinos unless it's free).  Although this restaurant also calls itself a Dim Sum restaurant  I would not recommend having dim sum here. (Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast offers much better dim sums)  The selections are very limited and I don't think they were made in-house (judging from the appetizers we had).

We arrived about 8pm on a Friday evening and the place seemed fairly busy.  We waited at the door for a hostess to serve us  but after several minutes with no acknowledgement of our existence  we walked in and got the attention of a server  and she sat us in her station.  She was very friendly and seemed to be in good spirits.  It is always nice to have a server with a happy disposition!  We both started with a cup of their roasted corn chowder with bacon and it was thick  flavorful and very satisfying. For my entree  I went with their grilled vegetable salad and added grilled salmon to it for $3 which was a bargain  because it was a good-sized filet (about 6 oz).  Our server said the salad was really good  but I am going to have to say it was just good.  While the salmon was cooked perfectly  the vegetables were just OK. Some were rather bland and the lemon caper dressing was a little boring too. Salt and pepper helped  but couldn't make up for an uninspired salad.  And while the menu lists asparagus as the first ingredient  there were only 3 very skinny spears  which was a bit disappointing.  My date chose the shephard's pie  which was a bit of a let down too.  It tasted like canned chili with mashed potatoes on top. I've had shepard's pie before  and they usually have a beef stew flavor  not a beef chili flavor.  Oh well.  He ate all of it anyway.  Our dessert was actually quite good ... We shared the apple crisp and it was a generous serving of Granny Smith apples baked with cinnamon and sugar and topped with pastry crumbles and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Very tasty and the apples were cooked just right.  Overall  it is an A-OK place and I would eat there again if I was in the area  but I don't think I would make a special trip for the food."

Spent $1400.00 on a sick cat  emergency visit  and while she survived through it (which they didn't think she would) they have no clue what happened to her to begin with. We brought our kitty home and within two weeks she had RINGWORM!  This is an indoor cat  perfect health  no exposure to outside except for her first visit to this vet's office. I had no idea that ringworm was so contagious and how easy it is for pets to catch it. It is practically impossible to get rid of  the vet even said so  and can live for 18+ months in an environment  even without a host.   They were convinced our pet got it elsewhere  or outdoors. It's an indoor cat  and the timeframe they told us that signs would start to pop up was exactly the same as her visit.   This has put a huge strain on us  our other pets  and our finances. I have since gotten it and so has one of our other cats. You can't imagine how much work this is daily.   During her stay  they had used blankets and towels  she was walking around a less than clean looking room  and while I am grateful she made it through whatever it was that made her go into shock  I cannot believe she contracted ringworm. They told us when we brought her in to have her ear rash looked at that they get ringworm cases in all the time  and when they went into detail about how hard it is to get rid of  I know there is no way that they clean that well  that often between patients  and that thoroughly that they could kill all traces of it.  Please- beware and be aware! Do not let your animal off of the exam table  don't let them wonder where may not be clean. Make sure the table is santized!

Damn straight.    If you go  try to take friends.  Tapas are meant to be shared so the more people  the more plates.  Order the empanadas  the duck rolls  the cerviche  and most everything on the menu.  I am not a fan of lamb so I stayed away from those dishes.  Atmosphere was pretty good and music generated a great vibe in the place.  Definitely recommend it.    **They just opened a sister joint next door called Dragonfly.  It's a sushi place."

The student prix-five they are offering now is $25 for a three course meal with wine pairings. The first course  a shrimp bruschetta  was amazing. It had a wonderful spicy and tangy flavor accented with some unexpected mint leaves. Unfortunately  the main course left much to be desired. My companion's lobster ravioli was well executed  but bland. However  my cavatappi was nearly inexcusable. A small dash of tomato sauce  some pasta  and a bit of sausage is a dish I make when I'm feeling lazy on a Sunday night  not something I order at a restaurant. Dessert was an ice cream sandwich made with snickerdoodle cookies. It was a little awkward having to pick something up with my hands while at  a nice restaurant and overshadowed by a sickly sweet wine pairing. The bill came with some rich caramel brownies  which made the price a little less horrible.   Service was attentive  if a little pretentious. But everything was overshadowed by the cavatappi.

Apparently what they were best known for was the vertical fighting scene which is the finale  and since the performer died in 2013 they replaced it with a ridiculous 1980s video game looking thing where you can't even tell what is happening...  Seriously  if they no longer feel safe doing that then just do a new scene with a normal fight or something.

"FKf7MUPLq3lYzvWTK_wgkQ","McyB48SVPMPLZn5GTF34FA",-0.0155440414508,1,"My nail technician was Susan.  I showed her a picture of exactly what I wanted (short french tips with rounded corners).  She began the process and right off the bat was very rough with the manual and electric buffers  especially on my cuticles.  I have not had a manicure in 12 years so I couldn't remember if they were supposed to trim your cuticles or not or whether the process was supposed to be painful or not  which it most definitely was.  After some research  I now know they should NOT cut your cuticles  because if they nick and cause an open would with their un-sanitized instruments  you could get an infection  and a potentially nasty one at that (think staph  MRSA  etc.).  And she did cut mine open... on the side of two fingers  my middle and thumb  to the point they bled a little.  And apparently you should not see any existing white powder on the buffers they use on you  meaning they have not been cleaned or swapped out after each client.  The buffers she used on me (manual and electric) had a considerable amount of existing white nail powder on them.  The charge was $30 and I gave her a $5 tip which I now know I shouldn't have and I really regret.  My nails did not turn out looking like the picture I showed Susan.  She applied the tips too far in  making my nail beds look short and stubby.  The rounded corners I asked for turned into rounded SIDES with sharp corners  looking very odd.  And there are visible air bubbles trapped under each nail's polish.  I can deal with the way my nails look but the thing I am most upset about are the two cuticles she cut and made bleed.  I washed them really well and used disinfectant on them.  It is now the next day and the wounded areas are puffy and red  so yes  they are infected.  I can only hope and pray it won't be serious and will clear up quickly.  I will be soaking them in Listerine today.  If the infections persist  I will be reporting this salon.  I cannot speak for the other technicians who work there  but if you must go there  DO NOT USE SUSAN."

After three vet visits and a month worth of medication and permanent eye damage  my shih tzu is partially blind because of this shops negligence. When I noticed my dogs eye I immediately called the owner who denied any potential wrong doing. Coincidentally my dog was fine before I dropped him off but when I picked him up he all of a sudden either got burned by a blow dryer or cut with scissors per the vet... ON HIS EYEBALL!!! I'm certain it happened at puff n fluff. The owner sounded concerned for his health and said she would follow up in a few days after the vet visit ... Here we are three months later and still no call. Sad because I went there for more than 6 years and no longer feel safe there. Highly recommend looking for alternate groomers.

They had one waitress on the floor and it took a long time to get her to come over. Ordered and told her no on the soup and she said it was free and still brought it  VERY DISGUSTING!!! Then a large table came in about the time the guy finished making our sushi and she went over and took the other tables order about 15 minutes and they guy didn't bring our food over  the waitress did after 20 minutes after it was rolled. It wasn't even rolled very tight  kept falling apart. I will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN  Unfortunately.  I liked the atmosphere  but seems like the quality of food and service has went down hill.

It was Friday at 5:30pm (matinee) and for two people it was about $30 because it was a 3D movie  but I still found that to be pretty damn expensive considering a 3D matinee ticket at Cinemark is only $11.25. The place is also very outdated. I'm sure if they had better lighting inside  the place would look horrible.  I'm surprised it still exists  but it IS the only theater on the strip. As Matthew C. stated  the theater rooms don't have stadium seating  so it looks very strange when you walk in  but I actually kind of like it because it make the room look huge. This is never my go-to place for watching movies since we have so many better theaters in town  but sometimes I come because the showtimes really fit into my schedule.

At least they started in Scottsdale  so it is a home-town company. This location is a little different than others and I really appreciate it. There are fabulous touches like the glass wall mural that really step the place up.   The food is consistently great and the service staff are always friendly. I'm currently hooked on a sweet dish I never would have considered from the menu - its shrimp  honeydew melon and walnuts and is absolutely delicious. Every person I go there with looks at me questioningly  then thanks me for ordering it because they never would have. Sweet isn't your thing? Try the fabulously spicy Bloody Mary to really really kick-up your night.  Yum!  UPDATE: New management = less consistent quality and service. However  even though its a Chinese chain  they have one of the best margaritas I've had anywhere in Arizona. Go figure.

With the tax and everything  it was $44 per person. And it was very much worth it!!  The decor and setting is beautiful.  Felt so posh  which is fitting considering the 44 dollar price tag haha!  The presentation of the food was just as stunning! Like the things you see on the food channel! Take lots of pictures  because they sure are photogenic!  Now to the most important factor: taste of the food. Um  everything we tried was good. Like  everything. HAHA! I dont know what else to say  we loved it! Delicious and unique.  I was able to eat foods here that I had never even thought about before.  Lamb gnocchi  duck ravioli  thai tea gelato.... As expected  you cant LOVE every single thing you eat  but honestly  whatever foods we did not care for  were still pretty good! I myself am not a fan of bone marrow  but my mom ate so much of it!  To sum it up  our least favorites foods were still pretty dang good! And for the foods that we LOVED  lets just say we ate 3 servings of each of them!  We will definitely be coming back.

I had made a reservation  just in case  but there were only 2 other couples in there so it probably was not necessary.  The hostess was super friendly and even made a little small talk with us while she seated us. The waitress came over right away  also very friendly. Water right away  but had to wait a tad longer than I was used to for the wine.  The glasses sat there  alone and empty. Also  the same glasses were used for white and red wines- not a huge deal but odd for un upscale eatery. AND...my pino grigio had a SCREW OFF cap  and cost $10. Ok  I understand that there was a cork shortage a while back  but  um  really?  The bread is definately something special. Two bite sized cornbreads with jalapeno and cream cheese filled puffs (yes  YUM!). Quite honestly though  I could have done without them as something to eat BEFORE dinner. They were way too heavy and seemed like something more suitable at breakfast. Just the cornbread nubs would have been enough-- those were light  delish  and just the right size!  I ordered the Crab Enchiladas and Green Salad. The salad was great- fresh greens  crunchy mango  peas  cucumbers and just the right amount of champagne vinagrette. The enchiladas....well the portion size was nice  and I enjoyed the spiciness.  However it was way too bland and creamy and I could barely taste the crab. The cilantro was barely noticable as well.  I realize that Spoon is not a mexican place  but the effort in making this dish authentic in any way seems lacking.  My friend ordered th Kobe Beef burger and fries. The buger was what you would expect of Kobe beef- soft  juicy  and literally melts in your mouth. I am not a huge beef eater  ever  but it really looked amazing when it came out and I had to try a bite. Again  something lacking though- perhaps a spice in the meat or salt....or something?  The fries were good though- served upright in a metal canister  sprinkled with herbs  light and crisp. I could have polished off a whole plate of those by myself.  Lastly  the Earl Grey and Citrus sorbet  which we split. The texture was too grainy and icy and it seemed like it was frozen and re-thawed a few times. OK flavor  but I couldn't really taste the tea.  I often judge my dining experience pretty heavily on ambiance  and I will say that Spoon does really well in that department.  It is warm and cozy inside with interesting art and metalwork. Again  the waitstaff was really great and made us feel welcome. BUT  the food just didn't do it for me.  I would return  but  perhaps for a cocktail only next time  as the bar is really hip and cool. But I would give some of the other new places in the neighborhood a chance first. One thing that I did enjoy though are the portion sizes.  Coming from CA  I often feel that portions are way bigger than they need to be here and I often overeat more that I would normally because it's there and I hate wasting food. Spoon definately knows what a normal  healthy portion looks like.   I am happy that Spoon is here becaue if fits really well in the new Penn Circle area of town. They just need to work on their recipes.
H_izKdxroSFEKFUUomxeuw,vSVWon_i19O3j-KM2-szeQ,0.156862745098,5,This is a very nice Hampton Inn. As a result of a corporate relocation  I had to stay there for an extended period  so I really got to know the lay of the land around here.The location is great with plenty of places to eat and shopping very close buy. The staff was always friendly and helpful and the room quality was excellent. I have stayed and many Hampton Inn's in my time and this one was right up there as one of the best. I would give this 5 stars for what you get in this category of hotel.
drS3ZN6-zA3sr5WM2fG5tQ,OyJ_CGX0-bh-7VicqfBXGw,0.207792207792,5,I love bookstores and although Barnes and Noble is a large chained bookstore  it still offers the same comforting feeling as a smaller bookstore.  The staff at this particular location are friendly  knowledgable and always willing to help. They recently went as far as helping me find a new and interesting book to read. Ready Player One was unique and quite interesting. I wouldn't hesitate to ask for another recommendation from this group of book sellers!
-mxOlSvK_EAF4rr-q8oWnw,Tr0APB-yiqu94QHO3eB66A,0.0784810126582,4,I'm going to start with four stars for the Castle. We booked here last weekend and the spot is amazing. I love the feel and the idea of the greenery and artifacts in the back which give for great after-ceremony photos (exactly what most of the venues in the city are missing). My biggest gripe is with their 'soft holds policy'. Personally  I have no issues with this. So  after touring on a Saturday and falling in love  I tell them my fianc\u00e9 and I will be back the next weekend with family because we want to lock down our October date that is still open. They tell us thats great  set an appointment  but again make it clear they cannot do a 'soft hold'.   The following Saturday 9 of us show up. Tell them we're probably going to book  and they mention another bride is INTERESTED...There are no soft holds though  so it shouldn't matter-right? So while I'M there touring with my family  the owner calls the other bride telling her there is someone else touring that is REALLY interested (I witnessed the call first-hand when I walked in to their office to ask for pricing to show my dad whom hadn't seen it). The owner is on the phone for a long while  and comes back to say 'the other bride is on her way down (!!!!!) but it's whoever gets the money in our hand first that gets the date  since we don't do soft holds'. When my dad says alright  we're ready  the owner says 'I don't want you making a rash decision because you feel pressure'.   At this point I'm almost ready to cry out of pure frustration  and tell the owner point blank  'If we walk out now so you can talk to the other bride  we will not be back'.   Ultimately we got the date we wanted  and the other bride got her secondary date  and came over to congratulate us after booking. Kudos to the other bride  but hopefully The Castle owners will provide for a better experience going forward and not make us regret investing thousands in this place.   Will update as things progress  and hopefully be able to increase the stars because I do think the place is absolutely stunning.

After every deadline and exam  my friend and I totter up to Monkeys and sit all afternoon long. It's a really cool pub  really relaxed and really nice to be in. They show movies all day and it's the sort of place you want to take your mum. It can get a bit crazy when it's busy  but on a nice afternoon there's nowhere I'd rather be for my G&T fix

The food is super good (we had the fish minus the chips) and a Boli.......YUM!!!! But look for John  he has a story or two! Seriously going back just to see these two guys!
UnzP6W9rvSZZg96Hx4lEOw,2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw,0.0235294117647,4,I'm usually not a big fan of hot sandwiches  but Earl of Sandwich inside Planet Hollywood may have converted me.  They feature a dozen different hot-pressed sandwiches  salads and wraps.   I chose the Full Montagu which had roast beef  turkey  swiss and cheddar cheeses and a spicy mustard. Delicioso! The sandwich alone filled me up  but I did see they had kettle-cooked chips and their own freshly-squeezed lemonade. This definitely hit the spot after a long flight from the east coast.

6ZF8eBDL_Bd5xZoLs0KziA,nmj5yK9dZ2atlM9RYDCRHw,0.0134228187919,1,We decided to try this for breakfast after getting our Christmas pictures done.  Big mistake.  It took awhile to be seated even though there were a lot of tables available.  We got drinks pretty quickly but refills on the coffee were non existant even after I placed both cup on the end of our table.  My husband ordered a ham and cheese omelette and asked for the hash brown w/out onions  I ordered the spanish omelette and asked for the onion to be cooked or left out.  It took forever to get our food and when it arrived my husbands hash browns were cold and loaded with onions.  Mine the onions were raw.  My daughter had a bagel and fruit that was fine but how can you mess that up.  On top of everything it was a litle on the pricey side.  We will NEVER go back again!
9SFdyU7WTTuqqu-a5Qo2jg,83C1eqPfmQHTy_8MC4Ug6w,0.0578512396694,5,When you go to Vegas there is a LOT of competition when it comes to places to eat.  There are plenty of places that you can go and get a decent meal  but there is basically nowhere that you can go to have your waitress bust out in a full on 1950's rock song while you are dining!  You can actually view a bunch of videos on YouTube taken at Roxy's to give you a feel for what to expect  but you really have to go there to experience it in person: http://bit.ly/cs7wtZ  Bottom line: Roxy's ROCKS! Prices were fair  food was very good  and the spontaneous singing was fantastic! Don't miss Roxy's!
jR5l97hPpunzRhWbPkJKEw,0qOf05JyHJopL0mE0qWMCg,0.127906976744,4,You have to know what to get. The bbq pork buns (both steam and baked ) were very good  especially when they just come out warm and fresh.  The pineapple bun (filled with cream) was also delicious.  However  the chicken baked bun wasn't that good.  And their egg custard  was so-so.  The service was good.  The younger women were nicer than the older woman when it came to asking questions.    We went there 3 times during our visit to Vegas.  The prices were average.
pbC-9qBPGHDSUJ67j-ckVA,uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw,0.104026845638,4,Party like a rockstar!  If you're looking for a luxurious  quiet  prim and proper hotel  DO NOT COME HERE! Planet Hollywood Hotel is for those who really want to party it up! I really enjoy coming to Planet especially to GAMBLE! Sometimes  I'll be gambling up to the wee hours of the morning and I need a high energy environment to keep myself going! I love how they have good music  high energy  dancers on tables  people yelling  all without being TOO trashy or dirty!   I stayed here a couple of times and I must say  the people at the desk are really friendly depending on how you play it out.  I read previous reviews about the $20 trick for an upgrade and it TOTALLY worked! They hooked me up with a suite and it was niceeee!  The room can use a little updating.  Even in the suites it looks like it needs a little bit of work.  But for the price and location  you really can't complain.  The main reason why I like staying at Planet is the location! Right across from the Cosmo  Aria and Bellagio and right next to the Paris hotel. I'm within walking distances from pretty much all the good hotels on the strip so if I ever feel like eating or playing anywhere else  I can just make a quick walk across the bridge.  I also love the fact the Planet is connected to the Miracle Mile so if there's anything that you need  you can just walk around and find it in the mall!  It's not the greatest and latest hotel. It's not the cleanest or most luxurious. But I honestly enjoy coming to Planet. You can find me at the craps table here!!
F9kZ5zBvRdejSNtjtiNeiA,NfdZgoNTGsfth9MS8Qaurg,0.144927536232,5,I ate here again for omelets. My personal favorite is the Brentwood which is open faced with broccoli  swiss  bacon  and more. Very good. A nice heaping of toppings paired with the perfect amount of eggs. The omelets come with your choice of bagel  fruit or toast.  But this is the place to do FRENCH TOAST. If I wasn't cutting carbs  I would order french toast every time.
FCxBY8fmF4g68Va1CEsBpg,VFRfBYycuieR56jZ6dgVeg,0.093023255814,5,I love lots of options and Yoasis has lots of options! 12 yogurts  endless fresh toppings  sauces like Nutella  Godiva chocolate and many more. I wish they had this place when I was a kid. I would have lost my marbles over it! My husband loves the recipes for yogurt mixes and toppings that they provide. They even have doggie frozen treats that my dogs go crazy over. I love that it's a mom and pop place! I wish there were more establishments like it.

We arrived with 9 guests and were seated almost immediately in a small private room off the main dining room.  The service was prompt  professional and outstanding!  The variety and freshness of the sushi and rolls was very  very good.  I would have no hesitation about going back.  The only down side is the limited parking in front of the strip mall  you may have to park in back and hoof it from there.

x7tfyEGyCcSGZ7xjmAM5aQ,U8RIy3r16fmuneo2stVuOA,0.139240506329,5,I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants all over the U.S. and this one stands out as one of the best. Went here with some friends and we pretty much had the place to ourselves on a Friday night  I don't understand how  because this place should be jamming all the time in Vegas. Excellent service and wonderfully scrumptious sushi! I'd highly recommend checking this place out while in town. Totally worth the drive.
N1rUsPsRaikH1SW_cAoJhg,4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ,0.142857142857,4,I've heard so much about this place so for this family trip to Vegas we decided to check it out.  We went for lunch instead of dinner because it was cheaper and it seemed more like a lunch place.  ATMOSPHERE: We made reservations so luckily we got seated in the greenhouse area  where it's all open with glass so you get to see outside but it's covered/enclosed so you dont have the heat/cold or wind.  It was perfect! Very pretty/and bright.  The inside looked kind of dark so I guess for a romantic dinner it would be nice but for a lunch the greenhouse area was perfect.  FOOD: They give you a baguette in the beginning  which was very crunchy and soft on the inside and still warm when they handed it to us.    FRENCH TUNA MELT TARTINE - If you didn't know  a tartine is basically an open faced sandwich.  It tasted like it says - tuna melt  so you taste tuna salad with lots of different veggies and toppings on top of the crusty bread.  Bellpeppers  onions  artichokes...it was good.  It also came with a little salad on the side  which was nice.  All of the hot sandwiches (which this is) come with french fries on the side.  They are very interesting and you can tell they make it there.  They are flat and thin  some are more crispy and some are more soggy but they were good and a nice addition to the sandwich.    SALMON SALAD - My sister got this and said it was good  it came with a good amount of salmon and the entire entree was definitely plenty for lunch portions.  My mom accidentally got the mixed greens which was a small plate and she added salmon to it  but my sister's salad looked much better.  Overall - I'd suggest making reservations for lunch for a light but great lunch where you feel like you're in paris on the street at a cafe.
1DUi6pRYXDT1oDFKCMsdzQ,XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg,0.0773195876289,2,soooo disappointing!  i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes.  also  having lived for some time in NYC  i am familiar with and a fan of Bastianich restaurants.  one of the best meals i've ever had in my life (there aren't many) was at Del Posto.  the Bastianich name to me stands for integrity and love / appreciation / sharing of high quality italian food.  then  i ate here.  are these the same people running this restaurant?!  it was completely mediocre and subpar  as if no one cared about the quality or experience.  i came here for brunch and did the pasta trio and antipasti table.  it was clear the ingredients were not quality and the dishes were mass produced without much flavor or thought.  it was only $25 a person  but can you make an effort?  don't you care about your reputation and good name?  guess not.  this restaurant seems to be a sellout - a place to make money off the name in a place where the food standard frankly isn't that demanding or high (like in NYC).  also  the service was not that good.  too bad.
Y7KS04okqSFAbg1NyImHkQ,jCUOqEK8Lln0PK3GeUl6IQ,0.0696517412935,4,As far as locally owned coffee shops are concerned  Copper Star is definitely tops. For one  it's an old gas station cutely repurposed as a coffee shops. The decor is hip with local art covering the walls. It's quiet-most of the time there are people there hanging out on their laptops. (Which begs the question-Do coffee shops pay people to hang out on their laptops? Even the grocery store Starbucks has people hanging out!) Being someone who drinks coffee all the time  I usually opt for nothing too fancy-an iced coffee will do  thank you very much. Oh and can you add some almond milk and vanilla? The coffee here is generally quite good  however sometimes inconsistent. It might not be the coffee though-sometimes the drink just tastes like the syrup is sitting at the bottom. For that reason  I have to knock off a star. :( I still love you Copper Star! Oh and I hardly ever do take advantage of the baked goods but they're always tasty. Get the S'mores brownie if they ever have it and share it with someone so you don't go into a sugar coma.
iM8cd2_d8vFX7U3kQGeaoA,IQ1EkfRxyChHEYs_lz86iQ,0.00826446280992,3,Second time staying here. Newer updated contemporary Springhill Suites (2010).  Room: the rooms are newly renovated. Lower level of the Marriott chain  so the beds are not as comfy  but it will do.  Service: the front desk attendants are friendly and greeted us every morning. Didn't have much interaction besides that.  Downside: The train that runs behind the hotel. It blows a very loud horn every time it passes in the middle of the night (eg. 1:33am  3:15am) If you are a light sleeper (which I am) ask for a room facing Oakland (amazing view of the Cathedral as well). They gave us that room the first time we stayed here  so I didn't notice the train.

gEdEGpvA7HrD0h76882TbA,d38y2fkW1542SaoSTvE1og,0.0670391061453,5,I won't wait in a line  anywhere. Waiting in line is not a good look. I make an exception for this place. One of the most reasonably priced places to eat in all of Vegas. They are consistently good. When in Vegas I have a crepe for breakfast  and another for a midnight snack.  Tips from a regular.....   - They stop taking orders about 15 minutes before they close. So if when they close at 11 pm  you need to be in line by 10:45 pm.   -  Order the combo. No matter the crepe's price  if you order a combo  you get the crepe and drink for 10.99. Depending on the time of year  the combo might be 9.99. The combo is a better deal than the rewards price.    - If you get a soft drink or coffee  just ask for your drink cup  then go next door to JJ's Boulangerie  for your drink. The crepe window is part of JJ's  and inside JJ's they have a larger selection of soft drinks and teas.

The special was a skillet with potatoes  eggs  house made pastrami  covered with Benedict...and Holy Crap was it yummy!! I was glad to see that the bar was full and the restaurant was packed at 11am on a Sunday.  I was equally glad that the venture out into the COLD weather was worth it.  NOW  if you would only bring back the vegetable gallette ;)
hRdhlyNVtVvcf7oLn2J1Xw,IwShjaQLAvqV2msU4bh3ww,0.198863636364,5,I love the Whining Pig so much that there is a huge part of me that doesn't want to write a yelp review. I happily stumbled across The Whining Pig on yelp a couple of weeks ago and have been wanting to check the place out ever since! Unfortunately my friends are all losers so I took myself on a date to The Whining Pig for Happy Hour! The thought of checking out a Wine/Beer Bar alone would be daunting  but whatever I decided to just go for it! I had such a great time  I happened to sit next to a super friendly Phoenix Fireman who kept me entertained for a few hours  Greg the ever friendly owner recommended a fantastic Chardonnay (that I might add was $5.00 for happy hour) and was friendly enough to open a Blonde ale beer to let me try since beer frankly scares me!  I can't wait to go back and partake is some trivial pursuit  listen to some awesome music and drink fantastic wine!
RadW7vAeQ8MUQSrCyLYkRw,FxKXpNvGoyLmipYQFDf5aw,0.283582089552,4,Loved happy hour - $2.50 microbrews  $5 appetizers (WAY better appetizers than your average place  though they could do to expand the options...sizes are a bit small but they're forgiven b/c the appetizers are unique and taste SO good...oh and the size of the appetizer salads ARE generous).  Friendly staff!  My friend LOVES the generous pour on their wines (especially during happy hour).
KvWny9qUZJKrqo_LYesgSg,znk1y9lL5zbR1s3EpeojZw,0.0481586402266,3,This place would have been 1 - 2 stars if my son hadn't enjoyed the unlimited rides.  We went to Fry's and got the family pack for $67 which included 2 adult passes  2 child passes and 2 unlimited ride wrist bands.  We ended up giving one of the child passes to someone in line buying tickets since we only had 1 child.  The festival is quite large with tons of food vendors and a lot of rides.    There is one booth there that sells their souvenir cups for $5 and then you can come back for free refills - they have about 4 different flavored lemonades (strawberry  blueberry  regular and mango) out on the table  and you can walk up and refill your cup.  If you need more ice  they'll gladly put more in for you.  The lemonades are a little bland  but for free  it's worth every penny considering the other food vendors charge $2.50 for refills.    As the evening wore on  the lines for the adult rides got extremely long that it wasn't worth the wait.  The kiddie rides had about a 5-10 minute wait depending on what ride you wanted to go on.  As for the ostrich?  I thought this was an ostrich festival - at the VERY far end of the park  there is a fence with TWO ostrich in them.  That's it.  Just 2.  You could see more ostriches if you went to the ostrich race  but you have to get there to get a seat at least 45 min before the race or you won't be able to see a thing.  We later saw that they were selling ostrich burgers...maybe that's why there were only 2 ostrich on display.    Overall  this was basically a miniature version of the state fair.  I wouldn't drive all the way from North Phoenix to go to it again considering we thought we'd see more ostrich with more ostrich-like activities.  But like I said  our son enjoyed all the rides and the smile on his face was enough for us.

For some reason it always seems like they only have 2 people working  the line inside and out is wrapped around the building  and more times than not- the order is incorrect. I will now go out of my way to find a better equipped location to enjoy my chicken.
_lmMNw0STDLEI1_qEro6Mg,sfu3PoDKstOM0V8xmsgkKA,0.0297872340426,3,I have never ate at Port of Subs before  so I decided to stop by one day to buy lunch.  I like how they slice their meats and cheese fresh  but damn  they are really stingy with everything inside your sandwich! I went with the medium (8) No. 5  which contained Smoked Ham  Turkey  and Smokey Cheddar Cheese. The cheese especially was sliced VERY thin  I could barely even taste it! I wish the lady who was working could have put more layers of meat in my sandwich as well  to make up for those thin slices.   Maybe I just happened to come in on a bad day  but there is nothing special about this place. The sandwich tasted okay and got me full  but I can't think of any reason why I would want to come back. I am actually a fan of Jersey Mike's Subs. Same concept - they slice their meats and cheeses fresh. I have not visited a Jersey Mike's here in Vegas yet  but the locations I used to frequent when I lived in California were awesome! They would really load up your sandwich with all the ingredients  it always tasted good  and the employees were friendly!

"QBQlErZajdIyXX84dvFUnQ","jGldmslgIegQNM5kvb851Q",0.0676056338028,3,"From the outside looking in this place looks like its very fancy. When you enter you walk right into the bar and a cluster of people. To get to the host to seat you  you have to elbow your way thru the crowd of people to get there. I did not care for that I feel in a place like this you should be greeted at the door. I meet a felow Yelper Vanessa M and she made reservations a few days in advance and very glad she did. This place was packed and the wait was rediculous. Once in the dinning room I noticed it was nice but not what I expected from the outside. The dinning room is huge and has upstairs seating. The waiters are running 100 mph. there was a table upstaris  with children and they were running up and down the stairs and was very distracting. We also were seated by the door to the kitchen  which was not the best seat in the house (lots of noise and traffic from the kitchen.        Now for the food. The menu was big with lots of options. They have a family style menu and an ala carte entrees  salads  soups  and apps. I got the chicken and potato soup and it was delisious. My only complaint is that I wish that it was thicker it was kind of watery. The soup had small diced up veggies and lots of big chunks of chicken.  For my entree I ordered the the shrimp with angel hair pasta and a spicy red sauce. It was a very rustic chunky sauce  definitely had a kick  lots of shrimp. The sauce was good but for the amount of pasta it needed more sauce. The only problem here was I ordered the full. Because they had a family style menu I thought that the full order would be the way to go. Our waiter i think was a little upset with that fact we were not ready to order right away. This was the first time here and the first time Vannesa and I meet so we were talking for a bit and looking over the huge menu. He should have warned me of the size of this dish. Vannesa ordered the Rigatoni D so he new I was going to be eating this myself. This bowl of pasta came out and I was for sure they had the wrong table. It was huge and could serve  5 easley with leftovers. (Vanessa posted a pic) I'm curious to see the family portion.  Vannesa realy enjoyd her dish. Lots of chicken. Her favorite part of the dish was the mushrooms.  Her only complaint was the sauce was way to thin and watery. For dessert I ordered the apple frittata. This was so good and I wanted to eat it all but dam that bowl of pasta was kicking my butt. It was $7.50 for this dessert and you could share it for sure. Vannesa new she wanted the spumoni right away and she loved it.   Overall I think this place is good but I will only give it three star for now. The food portions are rediculously huge and the prices are good. I like that you can order a half portion and full portions or even family style. (half portions ranging from $15 -$18 and full portions going for $18-$25). I feel the server we had was not the best  a little rude. He picked up my plate and took it away without asking if I was done. Its just as well cause I should have stopped eating that huge bowl of pasta but we were talking and I put my fork down for a min and he just assumed I was done. I hate when this happens. The servers need to mention the size of these dishes especially when you order the full. The decor was ok but the checkered table cloths were kind of cheap looking and not what I expected to see here. They make it look like its very fancy  white table cloth kind of restaurant from the looks of the ouside. Food good  portions huge  price reasonable  service ok. I will be back for sure."

We came in about 8:45pm they close dine in at 9:00pm The first thing that was said to us as they took our drink order is that they are closing at 9pm. Well that immediately creates the RUSH vibe. The last thing someone should say to you as you order is that their closing.   We quickly place our order  excited to see what all the fuss is about! As our food slowly came in we tried to quickly have dinner since we knew they would be closing. Not even 10 minutes into our meal my fianc\u00e9 takes a bite of his sweet and sour shrimp a pulls a long piece of hair out of his mouth. He was extremely upset  we sat there waiting for someone to help us no one was there. The lady at the front was on her phone as she sat at the register area. Finally I call over to her and she calls back to me across the restaurant. I didn't want to say what I needed to out loud but since it was hard for her to approach us I went ahead and said Well there is a piece of hair in our food! She then quickly yelled in their language and a server approached us.  My fianc\u00e9 was taking a photo of the hair cooked into the shrimp as the server snatched the plate while he was taking the photo. She then started yelling in their language took the plate back returned and said Sorry. She said she would bring in a new plate for us. They shortly replaced the plate for us and apologized again. By this time we lost our appetite and paid for the meal. NOTHING was compensated for the disgusting inconvenience of eating a piece of hair with our dish.   I just wanted to get out of there. They obviously didn't know how to handle this situation correctly. I suggest for any future encounters they may come across to walk away from the desk when a complaint like this is made. I also suggest to do more then re cooking the plate that had been returned. We could clearly tell it wasn't a new plate. Another place off the list! NEVER AGAIN!"

Usually when i encounter something this bad i have to immediately yelp the sh*t out of it but fortunately i proceeded to get completely trashed immediately following my last experience here and forgot to write the scathing review that it deserved.   Now that its been over a month or so since i visited the buffet the memory of it's horror has diminished (a bit) but i'll do my best to give it justice.  Ok  so here we are in Vegas  Buffet city right? so we figured we'd give the buffet at our hotel a try (btw  this buffet is at the Excalibur Casino which also sucks for many other reasons i won't go into here...).  When we got to the buffet we were presented with an option of $16 for the one time entry or something like $30 for the all day buffet   We opted for the $16.  Now me and the wife are relatively small people but we like to try lots of different things  so on our first round we each got about one spoonful (or the smallest possible serving) of about half of the items that they served.  After the first few bites  we gave each other a look  then a few more....   WTF?  we literally could not tell the difference between any of the foods.   I tried her plate  she tried mine  yep  the same thing.  so we pushed the food around on our plate and left it for the waiter hoping it looked like we ate enough and wen't back in search of more  hopefull better offerings.  Round 2:    Epic fail!   at one point my wife was pushing the plate away from her and grunting NO! like a 2 year old who doesn't want to eat  her creamed peas...  NO!  Round 3  Deserts.  Seriously  what the F is wrong with these people.  Where the cooks involved in a horrible taste bud destroying accident leaving them utterly incapable of adding flavor?   I don't get it  we saw all sorts of people around us wolfing this swill down so maybe we're just weird  or maybe people from California are just different than the rest of the nation... i don't know.  All i can say is.  Avoid at all costs.  in fact you'd be better off eating that stinking McRib that everyone always goes ape sh*it about.

We parked and I immediately noticed a jagged and shattered beer bottle in the parking lot in front of the door right by my new car tire.  (Nice touch...)  The inside of the restaurant is clean  a little crowded  but fine otherwise.  Our waitress was very sweet and helpful.  The menu was a dizzying selection of Mexican seafood that was almost overwhelming.  She brought us some chips and salsa  they were tasty  but the chips would have been even more delicious if they been served warm.  I liked the salsa  it was a brownish  low heat salsa that I've never had before.  It was pleasant.  I ordered the shrimp chevice tostada and since he's allergic to shellfish (the poor bastard) the husband had the cheese enchiladas.  We also ordered a side of rice for the baby.    My tostadas were okay  but they were store bought tostadas (because deep frying a fresh corn tortilla for each new diner is too much work?) and the shrimp chevice was way too limey (the overwhelming flavor) and not nearly spicy enough.  I would have preferred a few thinly sliced jalapenos and maybe some more cilantro in the mixture.  The red sauce on my husband's enchiladas looked watery and artificial and just like canned tomato sauce.  It didn't look very authentic  or good  BUT he swore it tasted okay.  (His tummy was also feeling a tad funny the rest of the day  but that could have been from almost anything else too.)  The baby's rice was nice.  It was served with peas  carrots  green beans and corn and it tasted quite good.  Also  the waitress served the baby first and gave her a plastic spoon which was thoughtful.  I suspect the waitress is also a mommy and that's why she got the baby's food out first and knew to give her a plastic spoon... ;)   Our bill for 2 iced teas  2 shrimp chevice tostadas  cheese enchiladas and a side of rice was about $23.00.

I have short hair and wanted just a trim on the sides and in the back. (My hair is slightly longer on top.) After initially resisting and saying he thought I was waiting for someone  the barber said he'd make an exception since I had waited.  The barber (Dan  I think) did a good job at listening to what I wanted and did a good job in a short amount of time. He let me check the length after he cut one side  and cut it a little tighter when I asked. Overall he did a good  clean cut. And he double-checked his work after I letting me style my hair with some gel.  I was charged $15  which is super reasonable for a woman's short haircut.

No  but if you want the real thing  you pretty much are resigned to flying to New York or maybe some retirement communities in Florida.  Outside of that  the meat and toppings were quality.  Fresh bread would've been better  but they did at least ship in a good brand.  The food court is fun too  and better than most of them for both food and ambience.  I'd say the one at Paris is up there on ambience  but frankly  the food options are a bit more limited.  I'd totally go back."

While we enjoyed our last stay  the room we stayed in was showing its age and use. To be expected though for a hotel that seems to be pretty popular. Actually  when we left last time we noticed new carpet stacked in the hall and the room had a survey asking customers about changes they would like to see in the rooms.  Well it looks like they took those suggestions to heart!  Our room looked freshened up and updated. The carpet was new and the bathrooms seem to be remodeled a bit...to include soap and hair product dispensers. Nothing too drastic  but nice updates.

"WqmrJgRcyBHiDwLg1DX3FA","BINYfrtGp3A4w0d5E7kbYw",0.0343213728549,2,"Me and my boyfriend came around 3:30 on Valentines Day to beat the crowd later. It was not busy at all so we decided to sit at the bar. The place is beautiful and you can tell they spent a lot of money on the decor. Our waitress/bartender told us that the place is beautiful at night for us to check it out sometime. I am definitely a huge sushi fan and I do go often trying new places to eat sushi so I was excited to try this place since it was close to our house. We ended up ordering two cokes and a total of five rolls since they didn't have the Kim bop roll which our waitress told us they usually run out of earlier in the week until they re-stock. So we ended up just getting five rolls since the last one ruined my night or we might have ordered more. The first three we ordered was the Las Vegas roll Happy hour price $5  Tootzy roll $5  and the Roll which was $14. All of which were delicious. These were bite size compared to how often I see others make the Las Vegas roll so huge in size. After enjoying the first three rolls we decided to try two more  the superman roll $12 and the spider roll $11. First one I tried out of the last two rolls was the Spider roll which was great since it has soft shell crab in it and that is one of our favorites. The one I had a problem with was the superman roll which is a spicy tuna/cucumber roll topped with white tuna. The first thing I tried was the white tuna on top of the roll and the second I put it into my mouth I got sick. There was just something so funny about the taste and the smell of the fish was foul. Mind you I have had white tuna many times before and never have I experience this smell and taste. My boyfriend suggested I try another bite of the roll since it may have be the sauce they put on it  so I wiped as much sauce as I could off and tried the roll again which didn't improve at all. At this point I was just plain sick & I couldn't even eat the rest of the other yummie roll we ordered.  I told my boyfriend we had to go because otherwise I would have to run to the bathroom and be sick.  So we asked our waitress for the check which they run our cards on iPads  something I haven't seen before which was cool. Our total bill came to $65 with the tip but with all the talking the bartender/waitress did she never minded to ask us how or rolls were so I made sure to let her know how sick I was before I gave her my card to pay. She informed me that white tuna is high in oil and that some people can't handle eating a fish like that and that the white tuna roll must have been us and not the them. So I informed her that I had eaten white tuna many times before and this just tasted completely foul. She did not offer us a discount which might have changed our mind in trying this place again and recommending it to our friends.  I just wanted to review this place to say how much it did make me sick enough to ruin the rest of our valentines day plans and that I am still sick the next day. We will not go back. If we do I guess it won't be for a while and we won't order the White tuna."

All I could do was laugh. Once we were seated  the service was very good (5 stars). We put in our drink order and it was brought to us with in 2 minutes! Nice job waiter dude! The sake was just horrible  probably the worst I have ever had (1 star) and let me tell you I can put back sake. The miso soup was pretty good (4 stars). The sushi was not the greatest. Their specialty roll was good but the rest were mediocre at best (2.5 stars). The price was reasonable but I don't think we will ever go back. My significant other really disliked Teharu  he voted for 1 Star but I thought that was pretty harsh. Anyway  I like the whole sushi on a conveyor belt idea. I have been to a couple other sushi places like Teharu and they are always fun and entertaining  but the sushi was much better. Hope this review was helpful for anyone that is on the fence!"

To be fair  here are a few positive adjectives that describe the overall time we spent at e: creative  friendly  intimate  knowledgeable  team work  and dedication. At the end of the day though  shouldn't all restaurants have the attributes I just listed? At the end of the day  OVER RATED! OMG! I read all the Yelp reviews below that gave this place 5 stars and thought WOW  this is going to be amazing  I can't wait  and instead  we walked away with  WOAH! We paid almost $600 for THAT?! What a joke! Later that night  we went to Aria where we were staying and ordered a plate of nachos and fries that was 5% of the cost and much more fulfilling.   You may ask  What about the experience? Well  if you've never been to a classy restaurant  paid for $75 for a nice steak  had a nice glass of wine or seen the Food Network  then I will say it again  over rated. Yes  the staff is amazingly coordinated  top notch and its a fun place to watch the staff at work  but I'd rather go to a Cirque show.  There are hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas and on the Strip and this place would not even hit my top 20 list.   Of the ~18 dished we had  I remember having one bite of a really nice piece of steak. The funny thing is  they actually showed us the entire cut grilled and we thought  shoot  what is that 10 oz  we can eat that whole thing  but instead  we got one slice each. The freeze dried sangria (1st dish) was a bit weird but interesting.  The beet pita with brie cheese was different but not something I'd prefer and would rather go to a cheese bar.  We made reservations a week prior to date we wanted and were lucky to get in. They made it so hard to give the credit card to reserve the time because they don't take phone calls and don't respond to emails on Mon and Tues. Maybe they think this process adds to their mystery and exclusivity. It's more inconvenient and annoying than anything and who really cares about a golden ticket and piece of paper that says you ate at e  not me. They asked us to arrive 15-30 minutes in advance to our seating and in the end sat us 15 minutes AFTER our seating time.  When you arrive to the Cosmo hotel  no signs or anything to tell you where this dungeon is- we had to ask about 4 people who worked at the hotel and then finally found it at the top level in the main Jose restaurant.

I totally agree with another reviewer who said that the room felt like an empty condo that we rented  not a nice hotel room. The room was big  but it was sparse  in terms of it wasn't nicely decorated at all. A lot of amenities were missing  including a hair dryer  sheets for the pull out bed  etc. Sure  they have a kitchen  but you don't go to Vegas to cook yourself dinner.   Also the walk to the MGM is VERY far. VERY far. And then once you get to the MGM hotel proper  you need to walk pretty far to get to the gaming floor.    The adults only pool at the Signature is fine  but tiny and you can't get shade unless you pay for a cabana.   Also  I did not like the service at the MGM Signature at all. The front desk people were pretty surly and no one seemed happy to be there  or happy to have me as a guest there. I won't be returning. For my money  the suite at THEhotel was much  much nicer."

Being in my mid-20s I have to say the atmosphere in this place is the right amount of grown. Yes  the crowd is slightly older but  did it feel good to get away from the douchebaggery Vegas can attract during the fourth of July weekend. Tips: *Do pay for the premium hookah it is all that more satisfying for a few dollars more. This is the perfect place in Vegas to sit  unwind  and get drunk so might as well have the overall experience and get hookah (or one of their Cuban cigars).  *Be sure to get the Scorpion Bowl. It's a great  delicious drink bombed with cherries drenched in Sailor Jerry rum. Made for 4 people to enjoy but it's even better for two!  My rude awakening from Carribean Paradise in Vegas:  What I had to knock this amazing place down one full star for was our waitress. It's highly unusual for my bf and I to undertip anyone but we were one trip away from ignore-ville before leaving without tipping at all! I will admit  she was the only waitress I saw during our whole 90min experience in the outdoor lounge but the place was not crowded nor overwhelming with demanding customers. She had the indecency to pass tables by teeming with customer's forever-ready to order their next round. We would have enjoyed at least 2 extra rounds if she would've been doing what she's actually payed to do: curteous service. I will be returning in Oct. and I'm hoping to have the same well-rounded experience AND attentive service."

Being used to BevMo in California  that's what I decided to judge it against. Place is definitely not for those who want some kind of decor. There's ads all over the walls like you'd see at some Sports Arena. Place isn't the cleanest either. But where Lee's wins out is selection and price. They've got some beers you're just not going to find in the Golden State. Biggest surprise for me was finding a four pack of Goose Island Bourbon Stout from Chicago. I would've liked to have seen more GI choices but at least they had something. But $20 for a four-pack? That better be really good beer. I decided instead to buy a strong Barleywine from a microbrewery in Salt Lake City. As in Utah. As in I just don't get it. Strong beer and Utah do not match up! Another plus is they offer discount prices if you pay with cash instead of plastic. Kind of like Arco without the oil slicks.They've also got a decent selection of those mini-bottles of booze like you find on airplanes. Well  at least you used to. But they're here and they're plentiful. Great if you want to go Vodka or Tequila sampling. Would definitely recommend a trip here especially if you hit the jackpot at one of the casinos. It's worth the ride."

Almost $50 for the lunch buffet with bottomless champagne  mimosas  and bloody mary's  including tip.  Best selections: Mussels  macaroni and cheese  fresh berries  sweet potato/pork hash  shrimp cocktail  Not so great selections: Sushi (but I guess I shouldn't have expected...)  seaweed salad (bland and flavorless)  my cut of prime rib (mine was tough  but my friends' liked theirs) ...and speaking of not-so-great stuff... No creme brulee :-(  I missed my Paris buffed creme brulee selection.  The other thing that made this buffet a 3 star  was our freakin waiter.  Oh my goodness.  5 of us had the bottomless drinks  but he was SO slow  would only bring back half of our drink order at a time  favored other tables over us  and was extremely forgetful.  We wanted our tip back.  I did enjoy the champagne.  The bloody mary's were just okay.  A little strange tasting.  I think I had 5ish drinks  so I definitely tried to get my money's worth in that way.

I will agree with the whole divey atmosphere  but that's part of it's charm. It does have free wi-fi  and I've used it a few times before shows and such. The staff is friendly  and the owner  Karen  is great! Karaoke on Friday nights is a blast  and the selection is pretty good. They have the Sassy Sisters drag show on Saturday nights  and other random shows (including fundraisers) throughout the month.   the downsides: 1- It's a cash-only bar. Personally  I think they'd run a bigger profit if they allowed bar tabs to be run on credit/debit cards. I mean  think how many times you've been drunk and just kept going up to a bar saying  Put it on my tab! The next thing you know  BOOM! $200 bar tab.   2 - The drink prices are a little high. And there's no set price for things. One bartender may charge you $3.50 for something  another may charge you $4. Their happy hour prices aren't much better than normal prices.   3 - Their cooling/ac system sucks. A lot. Get more than 10 people in the bar  and it's hotter than blazes! Especially during shows.   4 - From a performing aspect  the sound system sucks. Not during karaoke  mind you. Only what they use for shows. Loud noises on the mic blows the system. They need an upgrade... bad!   5 - you can't take your drink on to the patio. Sigh.   But honestly  those things can be overlooked because the atmosphere is great.

PIZZA is thin and crispy  but the dough has some chew after the initial crunch - exactly how I like it!  We tried cheese with banana  peppers and meatball/pepperoni/onions. When we return  we will probably stick with plain cheese. The only negative to our entire meal was that the onions were placed raw on top of the pepperoni/meatball slice. Those really should have been put on the slice prior to heating up in the oven.   EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA Hot Sub: The eggplant slices were a bit thick for my liking  but overall the sandwich was delicious. Great bread! The hot sub ordinarily comes with fried eggplant  cheese and marinara only. However  I ordered it with lettuce tomato and mayonnaise on top  and it was perfect!   CANNOLI: one of the best I've ever had. The cannoli shell is made in-house and it has a subtle cinnamon flavor that makes it unique. It's super crispy  and a perfect base for the not-overly-sweet cream filling.   SERVICE: the young girl working the register is a perfect representative for this business. She was helpful and patient when I asked questions about the menu. She provided plenty of information which helped me make my decisions. And she jokingly told me bye and that she'd see me tomorrow. Makes me want to go back tomorrow. :) The guy behind the counter slinging the dough seems legit. There were a steady stream of customers the entire hour we were there  but the guys in the back were friendly and unruffled.

I'm not sure what problems some other reviewers had with the kitchen at this place  but they were on top of their game the afternoon I dropped by.  The Korean BBQ appetizer didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as one would expect  but the meat was perfectly cooked  and the flavor of the meat shone through well.  The rice could have been stickier  though.  The burger I ordered medium was perfectly cooked  and wonderously tender and flavorful.  It certainly goes down as one of the better burgers I've ever had.  The fries were light and crispy  but could have been more numerous.  My friend ordered a very tasty upscale mac'n'cheese which came adorned with perfectly cooked and juicy chicken breast pieces.

"I1s5KcgH1siUR8Mgj08-ow","XB2ekZ7VveVl_ITRNV2Thg",0.0762910798122,5,"I've been doing some research on finding a salon to go to  to get my haircut. Like most women  I am VERY picky and nervous about getting my haircut and don't trust just anyone to do it. In my research I have noticed that trying to get someone on the phone at OTHER salons is somewhat of a challenge. Which just made my anxiety of finding a place even higher.  So  let's get started.... I called Cloud Nine this morning around 11:30am and I couldn't believe it  the phone rang MAYBE 1 1/2 times before someone picked up. I'm thinking ok  that's a good start. The receptionist on the line was VERY nice and polite. She was informative  friendly and above all actually caring. I told her what I was looking to get done and asked for a price range. She told me the price and asked when I would like to come in. I askedif there was anything available today. I completely expected her to say no  well I was wrong. I got an apt for 12:30. So at this point I'm thinking either I just got lucky or I'm gonna regret going to this place....  I get there a couple minutes before 12:30  I check in and sit down expecting to be there waiting a while. Receptionist again VERY friendly and polite. Offered me and my boyfriend a drink. Not more than maybe 2 minutes later Brittany  my stylist  comes up to get me to bring me back to the chair and she offers my boyfriend to come back with us(totally cool because not many places actually offer that).   So we get to the chair and get started. She asks what I want done and to be honest  I'm kinda clueless as to what I want done except that I want to keep as much of the length as possible yet have a new and noticeably new look. She offers up her suggestions  which I take but make it a point that she thinks we should start off longer than I want at first  just incase because we can always cut it shorter later  we can't cut it longer after its cut already. It's a great idea and she is totally right especially since I am very sensitive/particular about my hair to begin with.   Next we move to the shampoo/conditioning station. At this point I'm a little nervous so to speak about how my remaining time with her will go. I'm wondering is she going to talk to me  is it going to be completely awkward or is she going to just plain talk my head off? Conversation starts  which is very pleasant and enjoyable  as well as the little massage given while washing/conditioning. Whatever she did sent chills down my spine and made me completely relaxed.   Now that that's over we move to the stylist chair  conversation continues as well. I come to find out we have a lot in common. I felt so comfortable and confident with Brittany that I just let her do her thing without really paying attention(which I NEVER have done in my entire life when getting my hair done). She worked her magic with y hair  continued with reasonable amount of conversation  no awkwardness what so ever  even gave me compliments about my hair and best of all  she didn't push to try to sell me anything at all!! Brittany is also very knowledgeable about what to do and what not to do. She also didn't push to do anything with my hair that incident want. She respected me  my hair and my way of doing things  which I can't say about a lot of places.   Cut  blow-dry and style is done  she hands me the mirror and turns me around. WOW! I am beautiful!! My hair is perfect. I couldn't believe it. Brittany is absolutely amazing. She is kind  caring  informative and above all did everything I asked for. She understood where I was coming from  had funny stories she shared  was appropriately personable  made me very comfortable and very pleasant to be around. I couldn't have asked for anything better!!  I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone. Prices are VERY reasonable  staff is polite and respectful  salon is clean  comfortable to be in/very inviting and noise level is pleasant  not too loud and not too quiet. It's not some high upscale intimidating  don't touch anything  snotty staff  overpriced kind of place. Which I avoid like the plague. They also offer many other services  such as massages  facials  mani/pedi and waxing. I have every intention on trying the massages  mani/pedi and possibly a facial sometime in the near future. They do have packaged deals as well as gift cards and a client reward system! So if you are looking for anything I mentioned above  I highly recommend this place  I REALLY don't think you will be disappointed!"

I stayed there for a few days on business and would have continued to stay had it been more convenient to where I was working. The hotel common areas are very aesthetically pleasing  as it's sort of built into the walls of the buttes (rocks I guess?) on the property. I didn't get a chance to eat at their more upscale restaurant  but can comment that the bar/cafe area was simply average.  The pool area was great with my only complaint being the abundance of children (which is why I also said it's good for children).  My complaints? Given the low and spread out nature of the hotel  finding parking near an entrance close to your room (especially with a elevator) is very difficult. My room was probably a football fields length from the closest elevator (perhaps more)  and the only other exit on the opposite side had no elevator  so luggage had to be carried up and down 3 flights of stairs.  I also booked a resort view room  which turned out to be  window right out onto a rockface. Not horrible  but certainly not a resort view. The alternative  less desirable view faces the highway  but is also set above the city and has a much nicer view of the skyline or mountains. Unless you get one of the lucky actual Resort views  I would choose the highway view 10 out of 10 times. Also  while the hotel was renovated in 2013  it still has the original 1986 fixtures in the bathroom and some odd choices of furniture in the rooms.  Finally  I should note: I left a nice android tablet there when I left (inside a drawer). I didn't even realize until the night afterwards and called them around 1AM to inquire if anyone had found it. Thinking it was a lost cause and trying to figure out how to replace it  imagine my surprise when they called me the next day to said it had been found. The cleaning staff could have just as easily pocketed it  but they were honest and turned it in  allowing me to collect just a day later.  I'd stay here again the next time I'm in town  but I'd just ensure I get a different room.  Oh yea  the only other downside is that because it's sort of it's own  self contained resort  you won't be walking out on the town anywhere like you might be able to do in downtown Tempe  Phoenix or Scottsdale."
"s6K98YC3cMpmDPZExKyBDA","lF2dEd89OjwVG7SUEozlQw",0.0337837837838,5,"It feels senseless attempting to use written words to portray the three-day nirvana that was EDC 2012...but here goes nothing!  EDC 2012 was my third EDC.This year  I arrived in Las Vegas with two goals: the first  to not end up separated from my crew (which I somehow managed to do not once  not twice  but on all three days of EDC 2011)...and the second  to dive in to EDC headfirst and finish the weekend with no regrets...   Both of these goals were accomplished by leaps and bounds  despite the fact that EDC required my friends and I to bust more missions than I ever considered myself capable of (thanks in no small part to a wallet/EDC ticket/ID/credit card that was stolen on the dancefloor  our befriending of a lovely Canadian girl who had arrived in Las Vegas with nowhere to stay for the weekend  one friend's parents threatening the disownment of their daughter  and a host of other situations that brought my friends and I closer together than ever before). For the weekend to have turned out to be such a RESOUNDING success despite the onset of one shitshow setback after another shows how truly special and amazing of an event EDC is. Anyways  here are my highlights:  - Dusk 'til dawn! EDC's most unique characteristic is the festival's sunset to sunrise format  which demands as much as your body and your willpower are willing to put out - you'll find yourself with a reversed body clock by the end of the third day. Go for the three-day stretch - you'll find yourself with a newfound appreciation for yourself and the limits of your body.  - The talent! Insomniac spared no expense in assembling a world-class lineup of DJs for EDC 2012. In a span of three days  I was able to see Steve Angello  Kaskade  Calvin Harris  Dada Life  Knife Party  and a whole host of the best that electronic/dance music has to offer. Every DJ who played at EDC brought their A-game  throwing down banger after banger and keepin' the party rockin'. I will never forget screaming This IS Paradise at the top of my lungs while seeing Fedde Le Grand bring in sunrise with his tune of the same name...nor will I forget hitching a ride atop a VIP cart in the heart of the crowd during David Guetta's Without You  waving out to a sea of people  all of whom were cheering right back at my friends and I.  - The production value  stage designs and lighting effects that were nothing short of world class...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6NG_A-epYEpsJSugfAaTRQ?select=oKal-wTRBxCJjWzIhcaXig#6sN5BGLpzMnJjYIcjSyt_w  EDC fully displays Insomniac's credo - it's all about the experience. The Kinetic Field - although not as jaw-dropping as last year's office building-sized structure  was hollow  in that festival goers were now able to view sunrise through the stage itself. Equally breathtaking were the visual displays accompanying each DJ set; oozing neon colors and trippy illustrations came straight out of (the best kind of) an acid trip. I witnessed dozens of acrobats  costumed performers  fire dancers   and the ever-popular Mirror Man grace EDC with their talents; no details were overlooked in terms of the event's aesthetics. For example  the Red Bull Skydivers glided down to earth  shooting sparks each night...legit.  OH  and I haven't even gotten to the fireworks yet. It looks like EDC has prematurely spoiled my 4th of July...  - The sense of togetherness found within the crowds at EDC is unlike that of any other event. Because EDC calls for a serious investment of time  money  and energy  there's a filter effect that takes place. Obnoxious assholes and creepy hoodie-wearing tweakers are very much the minority at EDCLV (unlike most massive events held within the SoCal area)  and I can speak from experience in saying that the overwhelming majority of the people that I met at EDC were fun-loving partygoers who were very polite (making way for your chain of head-bobbing friends as you navigate a crowd)  down-to-earth  and friendly.   This same sense of good-natured behavior was emphasized by the Speedway staff and the Las Vegas Metro PD; when my friend lost his wallet  the police officers whom we asked for help were very much courteous (albeit powerless  as no definite lost & found had been set up...lovely). Did I mention that we hitchhiked our way back to the strip with some awesome Good Samiritan ravers on the first night (due to aforementioned stolen wallet)? EDC gives me faith in the good nature of human beings.  I could go on and on  but really you'd have to experience EDC for yourself to fully know just how inspiring and life-changing of an event this is. I didn't really touch on the cons of EDC 2012 (god-awful traffic to/from the Speedway  inept organization with regards to the lost & found  a lack of food options to choose from  Mother Nature giving Saturday night the middle finger)  but frankly  that's because all negativity had been erased from my mind for the weekend. For three days  EDC enabled my friends and I to touch the sky!"

If you want something that satisfying and doesn't kill your diet  try a bowl with no rice or beans but get a scoop of chicken AND Steak.

When I first walked in i noticed it was very nice and clean which is a good thing. The receptionist of course tried to shove the package down my throat but no biggie I know that comes from the higher ups.   The reason I gave this 3 stars is because I was very uncomfortable with the process. All places that offer Brazilian waxes (at least the ones I have been to) they introduce themselves then leave the room for a couple of minutes so you can get undressed and get comfortable. No this place is an in and out type of salon so they have you undress right in front of them and hope right on the table. This made me feel really uncomfortable because I am a short not so skinny girl so hopping up on a table pretty much naked in front of someone you don't know was very weird.   The girl who waxed me was very nice and kept conversation so I wouldn't think about what was actually going on. The wax without the strip was pretty cool but really no difference in pain. Still always hurts like hell but that's the price we have to pay for beauty :o).   The other thing was after the wax she of course tried to sell me products that I just had to have and the package. I guess saying no once isn't enough. I was asked like 4 times for each product.  Not sure if I will ever go again. I mean the price is wonderful but not sure if it's worth the hassle and awkwardness that comes along with it. Really surprised on these reviews no one has mentioned anything about the getting undressed in front the esthetician.     PS. Wax looked great though :o)"

At first glance  one would be overwhelmed by the never ending islands of food. Then you start to think okay  maybe I can get through all of this. Just when you think its over  and you're almost ready to move onto the OTHER side of the room onto the dessert bar  another 3 row full of island filled food stands before you. Don't fight  Buffet: 3 You: 0.  (The journey...skip to the bottom of the paragraph for the in all) I've never heard of this place before we came here  all we knew was that it had a lot of great street cred. It definitely knocks the Bellagio buffet out of the park  and this place seriously left me walking out of the place with a food baby (i hope i don't have to explain what that means). The funny part is that I thought I could beat the system and try anything that looked very good by getting ONE piece  the tiniest even. I started from the front (the back where the pizza was) and I remember feeling that first kick in the stomach when I reached the miniature New York Steaks. Yet  like a fool I kept going after 10 minute  intervals. Finally  I reached the end after many skipped dishes. Then came the dessert bar  that's when trouble started to rise. The dessert bar had your run of the mill Bellagio type of dessert bar with a bit of a kick  a few special little dishes here and there  then came the gelato or really sweet  but like  smooth  almost like  fro yo type of ice cream (actual description from someone behind me while standing in line to get my scoop). The gelato had some pretty good choices: Cookies and Cream  COFFEE (!!!!)  Rasberry  Mint Chocolate Chip  Mango...etc.  My first try was the mango  and it was the best mango gelato ever! Later  my cousin and I did double scoops of the gelato onto a cone...we were in a hurry  so we wouldn't miss a show. It was worth it.   In all  this buffet beats all of the other buffets in the bum. Each island is filled with endless variety (from sushi to multiple types of pastas) and will surely satisfy anyone of your fellow mates.  Such a great place to go and grub right when you reach Vegas (especially if you drove your way to vegas) and definitely a great place to go after Vegas strip touring/partying/shopping  whatever you wild stuffs do there.

If you're just trying to go somewhere cheap and get the job done in Sin City  by all means this is your choice.  Prior to actually staying here  I heard a lot of negative remarks about the hotel. While it doesn't compare to most of the high-end hotels on the strip  it isn't something to necessarily put down all the way.  There's a lot of plusses to IP. It's located in the middle of the strip  and if you're someone who enjoys low minimum tables  not only is IP a great spot  but it's right between O'shea and Harrah's (my favorite places to gamble since I enjoy killing time on the 5 dollar blackjack and craps tables). It's very lively in the casino  with celebrity look-a-like performing often  and a pretty fun crowd to gamble with over all. Oh  and they did a damn good job picking their cocktail waitresses  because every time I saw one I swear their cleavage was going to poke my eye when I looked.  Now  there are a few things that IP can improve on. It's an old hotel and you can definitely tell when you step to your room. The TV is an old school 15-inch that seemed to have been purchased when colored TV's were invented. The shower runs very weak (at least ours did) and the only light was our lamp which the room very  very dim.  Lastly  I'm young (early 20's) and prefer to be around young people as well in the hotel. You will NOT find that type of crowd at IP. Not a surprise since it's older and has this popular reputation of being you get what you pay for  but these people were looking for cheap like me so I can't blame them.  Would I stay there again?

The ingredients are fresh and I love the fact that every sub is freshly toasted.  All of their locations are incredible but this one gets the fifth star. Why? Because they serve draft beer! The beers are priced very reasonably. Something like $3. Thanks to the bar area you can get a cold one and meet some generally awesome people.   This location is also insanely close to my house which is also a plus.  Stay cool Cheba Hut."

"8PBPO7SRfTfPFeL9UqtNqw","ByQ0OMxfdPoGgXLYnnN8Dg",0.00275482093664,5,"Bixi made our trip to Montreal an absolute blast. Since we didn't pack bike locks in our carry-ons  we were a little confused on what we would do with the bikes once we got to our destination  but we figured out quickly that there are Bixi stations EVERYWHERE. We never had a problem finding a rack to clip our bikes into so that we could walk around  grab some food  or whatever. No pre-planning or mapping out your day required. If you see somewhere you want to stop  or need a rest  you just clip the bike back into the nearest rack  do your exploring  and then when you're ready to ride again you swipe the same credit card you rented the bike with  get a new four digit code to unlock the bike  and you're on your way. You only get charged for the 24 hr. period; that is to say you don't get charged every time you swipe your card. You can clip and unclip as many times as you want. We did get the $200 (per bike) hold on our credit card  but it just stayed in pending transactions until it fell off a few days later. I suppose this could screw you up if you were using a debit card  as opposed to a credit card.   We saw so much more of the city than we ever would have on foot alone  and had so much fun taking full advantage of the very bike-friendly city plan of Montreal. I would say we're both moderately active (I run two miles two or three times a week) and we had no trouble navigating the city and managing the physical aspect of it. Obviously  you chart your own path  so if you're not in very good shape  you could keep your rides short and on flat ground. The bikes are easy to ride and while sturdy  they aren't too heavy to pedal around the city very easily.   The bikes also have a nice basket and bungee cord set up on the front  which we used for our backpack/bags throughout the day."

After he yelled at this poor guy in front of everyone and embarrassed him  he stormed off to the back of the store hitting and throwing things with later a door slam. Meanwhile there was a big line with customers waiting to get helped. The food was good but its a damn shame that the rude a$$hole manager had to ruin this for me and other customers in there.

OK if you're on a tight budget.  Pluses: * Front desk upgraded me 2 levels  and the rest of the staff is friendly; * Room they upgraded me to is pretty big * Not including room  the place has aged well.  The outside still looks good (it was built back when Vegas was trying to be family-friendly...ha!) and both the outside and casino area have aged well and don't look dated.  However...  Minuses: * The room is pretty dated.  The fact it was built in the 80s is very clear here.  I think the TV has to be at least 15 years old (it does work well though.  But the channel choices are pretty limited); * Cleaning staff could do a better job cleaning; I found a bunch of toenail clippings near the bed; * I worked late so ordered a steak thru room service.  Meh  pretty mediocre  salty and not worth the $26.  (in fairness  the salad I had the next evening was very good);  Random: * has a resort fee.  Internet access included in the fee; * For some reason  I slept well here.  There's nothing special about the bed  very typical old-school mattress; I would even say the mattresses are quite old and need replacing. * There's a guard at the entrance to the hotel parking garage  and you must stop and roll down your window to get in.  I've been to a lot of Vegas casino parking garages and I've never seen this before.  I had no problem with it (I kinda liked it  probably keeps things more secure)."

I stopped in mid-shopping on a Saturday afternoon. Loud pop music and perky staff. I ordered a veggie burger (which was more expensive than a beef burger) on sourdough with cheese and avocado added  with fries and a drink. The cashier  while very sweet  seemed a little flustered and confused with the ordering system.  As I waited for my order  I poured myself an iced tea. They have a great unsweetened tropical iced tea.   I waited a good 10 minutes before my number was called. I noticed my burger didn't have cheese like I ordered. I took it back and they cheerfully fixed the order and brought it back to me with the cheese. I checked the receipt and noticed that there wasn't cheese on the order  so the fault landed on the flustered cashier.   The burger itself was tasty but nothing extraordinary. All the ingredients were fresh tasting and of decent quality. I highly recommend ordering the sourdough. It complemented the veggie burger perfectly. I was annoyed that the avocado wasn't distributed evenly. If I'm paying a few more bucks for upgraded fast food  I expect a little more care be put into assembling. The first half of my burger was brimming with delicious avocado flavor but the second half barely had any. The fries were good. Not fresh cut or anything but nothing to complain about.  If I'm in the area  I would stop by again for a quick lunch  but I would not go out of my way to come here."
"FHSOR7FlOJOh6RjejrDwRQ","JYcUBXur4J_gNdeSHd4njA",0.0426356589147,3,"Originally the space that housed the Pike's Ice Cream and Soda Shop (now in Southend) that was attached to Pike's Pharmacy (still there) on Shamrock  they have kept the vintage look in this tight little space.  The old school bar is decorated with vintage Jim Beam bottles which I am told are still full (oh my...).  The best way to describe the food at Foskoskies in my opinion is gourmet blue plate... at gourmet prices.  From what I was told before going  the crab cakes were the must have off of the menu.  They were pretty tasty  especially with the remoulade sauce that adorns it.  I gradually made my way through the whole menu with friends and family since it is only a block and a half from my house.  My favorite is the meatloaf and mashed potatoes  although I usually sub fried okra for the asparagus.    The desserts are fresh daily and insanely good.  You can also still get tasty milkshakes as if the pharmacy ice cream shop never closed.    The beer selection is mostly craft beers that are going to be pleasing to the true brew aficianados  but a little much for the casual beer drinker.  They have a quaint little patio out back and can open up the space next door to accomodate larger parties if you call ahead.  That leaves the pricing as the only hiccup in my book.

Recently visited Goodwich and Art of Flavors in the same plaza  and knew it wouldn't be long til I'd be downing arepas  too...  Scouted out the menu online  cross referencing it with reviews here  and ultimately decided on the #1: shredded beef and the #7: reina pepiada  plus a side of fried yucca. Total came to just over $15  which was a bit pricey IMO.  The arepas were unique and tasty  but fell a little short of my expectations. The shredded beef was a little on the dry side  but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too  but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites.  Luckily  the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky  it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got  most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.  Service was okay: minimal but friendly  brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria  but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in  all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself  I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380. For folks advertising inside of a restaurant  that seems a bit unrealistic  but what do I know.  Might come back and try a few different flavors  seems like the BF and I could share three- they look deceptively small but they're very filling. But I'll definitely be adding on the yucca.  Side note: though a lot of other reviews mention the lengua arepas  and they look AMAZING  they no longer carry lengua here. So sad about that! :("

I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees  but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places  what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)  the flavor was pretty bland  i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy  but just still bland  no bueno. plus  for a thai place  they did not cook the tofu well  it was totally bland  too.  i was disappointed  but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour  too  but we got in and out pretty quickly  so it's good for a work lunch.  ***update 1/08 I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review  because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary  that's about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu  but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.  It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because  what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional)  is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small  like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order.  *definition of soooo nice and helpful: She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and  one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar  so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food sweaty. RIGHT ON!  that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half   *************************** i'm bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yupha's House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it."

We also ordered spring rolls  and they were delicious.  Had a sweet taste to them  but were fresh and crisp.    I would come here again for sure.  They're green curry (on a scale of 1-10) is about an 8.5 or a 9."

It was a delightful experience. The hotel was extremely clean and smelled great! We got an upgrade as well as a room with a view of the strip. No regrets there! We were able to see the fireworks and the pretty city lights :). Loved the kitchen with the bar  loved the bathrooms  loved the jacuzzi bathtub  but most of all  we loved the bed!!! We usually try to get out and do a lot of things but on one of the days we just slept in and it was wonderful. We didn't spend any time in the living room  which also had a giant tv and a giant L-shaped couch which would've been nice if we had guests to entertain. By the way  they have this tv built into the bathroom mirror over the sink which was cool because I like to watch tv when I go twosies (I swear that's what the tv is there for!) Aside from the awesome room  the shuttle service was great for our day buffet trip to the Bacchanal and there were always taxis waiting. 5/5 experience. We will definitely book here for our next trip!"

However  make sure you have plenty of time for the chefs and waitresses to delay your day.   We had a group of 9 and we all ordered fairly simple stuff. I had the deluxe mixed fry combo which was a decent deal. After i finished my meal  30 minutes~ we are still waiting for 3 entrees to be served. How hard is it to make 2 tonkotsu wiyh rice and a rainbow roll? It ended up late by 1 hour.... Most people would have left or canceled by then but its hard to move a wheelchaired grandparent to another food place.   Theres also other tables that ordered much later than us that are getting their tonkotsu. They didnt forget  because i reminded them every 15 minutes. Its funny because everyone else has finished their meal and im here sitting in the restaurant typing this review.   The food itself was decent. Everyone was well made but theres nothing to write home about. Free green tea as well. If service wasnt bad  this would be a 3.5 star.

I had walked by it several times on my way to other Japanese restaurants in the same complex  but had never noticed it since it's incredibly discrete.  As an aside  it is unfair to the rest of the world that we have so many amazing Japanese restaurants in that complex.  Dinner was exactly what we expected it would be: Divine.  I wasn't too eager to do the grill  so just got the Nigiri tasting but the 3 others in my group stepped it up a notch.  The preparation  presentation  delivery  and explanation all compounded to create a truly remarkable experience. While some of the tastes I didn't much care for  there was no doubting the quality of the basic ingredients. Having tuna from Spain and Sea Bass from Fukuoaka was better than expected.  I can see people being surprised by the price  because it isn't cheap. That's the price for the type of fish and the years of experience accrued to deliver it in such a fashion. The service is also absolutely top notch  which is expected at the price point.  In short  I'm looking forward to experiencing Kabuto again but I will reserve it for special occasions because Kabuto is  in itself  a special occasion."

I have been obsessing with tartares lately and this menu included several varieties including a bison tartare.  After the elite event we headed over to just grab a bite  a few appetizers and then we'd head over to eat dinner somewhere else. However  I was drawn to at least 2 apps and my bf had his heart set on the Hachoir 2.0 burger  so we decided this would be dinner.  I ordered the foie gras sliders along with the bison tartare and my boyfriend stuck with his longing for the Hachoir 2.0 burger.   The foie gras sliders aren't exactly typical. I was kind of expecting the usual: little burger buns with seared foie gras inside. Instead  the plate came out with a generous portion of foie gras  balanced atop little toasts  garnished with pickled red onions. Simple  delicious and low-carb (wink  wink)  The bison tartare (I ordered the appetizer size) was still a nice portion of tartare  in fact  I can't imagine eating more than I did of it. It was hearty  decadent and yet  still felt kind of light. Strange  maybe it is the citrus  but I didn't feel overloaded. It was quite good  and I look forward to trying some of their other tartares in the future.  By far the hit of the evening was that burger. It's a shrimp and pork patty  with bacon and grilled pineapple  and some very Asian inspired flavours. The brioche bun and the light hit of srirachi and sesame oil made this burger shine. The accompanying fries were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside  just the way I can appreciate them most.  Great service  with a cool and relaxed vibe.

You have to line up to order your food at the front counter  with no guarantee of finding a seat...the chances of which aren't very good since this place is packed during most of its hours of operation.

I prefer cheese curds with more substantial breading  so these were not my favorite.  Our burgers were also greasier than I am accustomed to. After cutting mine in half  I had pink grease sliding around my plate. The flavor of the burger was disappointing--an overpowering amount of pepper masked the flavor of the meat.

My favorites were the fries and the original burger. The fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor  especially the aioi. The original burger had the flavors I like most  although I think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.  To me  the burgers are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite I would want again and again (I still prefer Bachi burger or even Holsteins). The tacos were definitely a let down- super small portion of tuna and not very interesting. Overall  I would only come back for a beer and some of those fries."

I am a self-proclaimed italian food snob but maybe I am the one that has bad taste.  I highly doubt it but I'm so baffled at this point that I have to explore all options.  I don't need to write too much on this restaurant.  I was always taught growing up that unless you have something nice to say  don't say anything at all.  So  I'll get straight to the point.  Charlotte lacks truly good Italian food which is why so many people rave about the places that are mediocre to horrible.  I have to believe it is because you have yet to try really good Italian.  I usually don't eat out Italian but the times I have I always order something very basic.  To me  the mark of a really good  authentic Italian restaurant is told by their spaghetti and meatball dish.  If you can get the sauce right then you have my stamp of approval.  Seriously.  I have tested that theory with the best charlotte has to offer in terms of italian and it has held up quite well (ie Fiamma  Zio  etc).  Bottom line...they just aren't that good.  I ordered my usual spaghetti and meatballs and the sauce tasted like ragu with a cup of sugar added.  The meatballs weren't bad.  They were almost good.  The bread was not fresh  it was frozen rolls from Harris Teeter that were not even warm.  The rest of my party tried a couple of the chicken dishes and chicken parm.  Some said their food was pretty good but I had to consider the source.  One being my brother in law....he thinks guacamole is an exotic delicacy....soo....  The decor was dated as others have stated but I don't even care about that.  If the food was amazing then I could care less if it looked like a roach should be leading me to my seat.

Although unplanned  I was excited recently to get a truckload going to Vegas and flew in the wife for a 2 day whirlwind occasion.  Priceline got us a $39.00 room which was amazing until Excalibur hit us with their $12.00 resort fee.  It wasn't the money as much as the trickery involved.  30% over an agreed upon and contracted price - after the fact - hello.  These fees are for the extras such as a swimming pool (that closes at 9pm)  Internet and cell phone signals (which didn't work)  and a telephone and tv in your own room.  Even roach motels have all that.  When I explained I didn't need incidentals  they insisted on putting a hold on my credit card just in case.  Just in case means they earn interest on your money the following week before giving it back.  Their entrances are filled with persistent sales leaches who they encourage by providing them with the stations from which to badger you.  No knights or ladies with flowered halos to greet you (like in Hawaii).  While navigating this maze of blue blazered pests  you're asked by a slew of them if you would like to see a free show tonight  eat cheap and get a free nights stay..........only the shows aren't really free and they aren't tonight but you'll find that out 10 minutes into the scam.  If you pay $$$$ towards your NEXT VISIT......hey Excalibur  I didn't come here to revisit Timeshare tactics nor tell the same girl 5 times to get out my face.  If she's working your door then she needs to be parking my car or toting my bags.  I came here to be Knighted and left a Jester.  Our first room had a view of a industrial rooftop air conditioners. Not below us but  directly outside our window.  After complaining  we received an older room on the 26th floor but on 3 separate occasions had to ride back down the elevator  waltz across the casino and wait in line in the lobby to get our magnetic room keys reset.  Unplanned 30 minute trips sucks at 3AM.  While watching a football game in the casino bar we noticed signs announcing a $2 special for a beer and dog.......its been my experience that Vegas casinos offer free drinks when you gamble but evidently the Excalibur wasn't told of this tradition so I found myself paying for 8oz drafts while feeding their bar slots.  At the very least  you would expect that the hotdogs would be quality......a brat?sausage? footlong?  WRONG.  How about small child's Oscar Meyer weenie in a cold bun......no mustard  chili  cheese  saurkraut  nada.......Truckstops have better.  My expectation were dashed so we chose to gamble elsewhere.  Thank God we didn't plan an entire week around it.  It reminded me of some of the seedier turn and burn bars on Bourbon St.  Of all the cool clubs my hometown of New Orleans has to offer  certain clubs have a policy of discourage locals in order to prey on unsuspecting and ignorant tourist. It's a grab policy steeped in this will probably be their only visit here so let's rape 'em.   At least New Orleans has the Lucky Dog.

It's the same as the good ol' original in Cotswold  but with a slightly different interior layout and a much more awesome patio.   Same great beer selection  amazing fish tacos (of which I will argue are the best in town)  and that killer Secret Pizza Menu. Definitely worth a gander if you've never had a chance to do so.   The factor that makes me want this location in the ATL is the disc golf basket out front. Not only is it a perfect distraction for the kids to go out and play  but it's a great way to kill some time al fresco with a beer in hand. Really love what they've done with this spot.

I've been traveling to Vegas for quite some time and like to think I know the ins and outs and with that being said:  Executive shuttles are the most cost effective way of getting from the airport to your hotel.  Price Structure: Strip Hotels: $6 Off-Strip Hotels: $7 Downtown Hotels: $9.50  A cab ride to just about any hotel on or around the strip will run you about $15  so if you're traveling by yourself  Executive shuttles are the way to do it. However  do not  I repeat do not purchase a round trip fare. These shuttle services are not to be used from your hotel to the airport.  You will find yourself waiting and waiting for the shuttle and either making a late arrival check in or missing your flight altogether. You've been warned."

I guess folks who stay at swanky resorts (this was our first time springing for such a place) eat different food? LOL.   Get it we did!   We ordered a pizza to go from the adjoining pizzeria and while we waited on it we had a chance to shop for wine  pastries  salads and other take out from this charming little grocery.

T3ISRzQ1fQPkUANyokIgAw,UEyXv6C3CyxVYmxRDWYgUQ,0.113725490196,4,I gotta say  my initial impression of this place wasn't a good one. We walked in just after noon and found only 2 other tables in the entire place to be occupied. Then when we got seated  we had a super weird start where we basically got juggled around with 3 separate waiters/waitresses coming up to our table. Luckily  it was smooth sailing after that and I was extremely surprised with Biscuits Caf\u00e9.  The restaurant itself is located on the SE corner of Sahara & Durango. Inside  they've got a really big  spacious dining room and they seem to be doing a great job of keeping it clean and organized. Instead of getting too into detail on what it looks like  I'll shamelessly plug my first opportunity to try out the Yelp video function. ;) *Although you might have to go to the business photos on the mobile app to find it*  As far as the food goes  they have a fairly large menu with choices for both breakfast and lunch. I ended up going with the Zesty Chorizo omelette and was really impressed. The chorizo was cooked perfectly  had great flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat. All the other ingredients were fresh and aside from tasting great  the portions are huge. They literally put what looked to be an entire avocado inside the omelette and it's served with a side of your choice  and biscuits. The salsa appeared to be fresh made and was easily one of the best I've had in a breakfast joint. My only complaint on my plate would be the potatoes. They were cooked well and also served as a huge portion  but they were lacking in salt. If I were to order this omelette again though  I'd ask for extra cheese.   Now  with a name like Biscuits Caf\u00e9...they better have some good biscuits! Were they the best I've ever had? Probably not. But they are solid and in my opinion  far superior to what you'll find in most other restaurants in town. Buttery  flaky and served with both fresh butter and jam. You can tell they are fresh made every day and even though I'm not usually one to get biscuits for breakfast  I'd make sure to get one every time I'm here. Biscuits and gravy fans will love the version here.  Aside from the weird start  the customer service is great too. I could be wrong  but it looks like a family run joint and even if they aren't  you can tell they put a lot of love into their food. As others have mentioned  it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting busy and you're waiting for a table. It may have started off bad and a dead restaurant at peak times  is almost always a red flag...but Biscuits Caf\u00e9 is serving up huge portions of killer food at great prices  and I'll happily be a repeat customer!

I have no idea what the ingredients are  but just know that it brings back both memories of childhood and binge drinking in college all at the same time. It literally tastes like a spiked  very flavorful Orange Julius/Orange Bang.   Yes  I'm talking to you kids who grew up working class. You remember  ORANGE. BANG. It's sooo good. It's soo good that you get lulled into drinking more just because it's just so damn tasty. I have tried cable cars elsewhere  even at some of the finest restaurants in LA and SF--but it's just not the same. The one here is officially  my favorite adult beverage in the world.

We were starving and I had read good reviews on Yelp a while back so we decided to try it out. Lebanese restaurants typically have the most drab decors  so we were pleasantly surprised by Omnivore's warm  earthy feel. The staff was pleasant  attentive and courteous.  We both ordered kafta sandwiches (Beirut and Roma) with the fresh lemonade and sides of fattoush and lentil soup. The sandwiches were excellent and we loved the homemade lemonade! The fattoush was pretty good  and my friend liked his lentil soup.  I love that they have twists on the classic Lebanese dishes such an Indian version of the kafta sandwich. The food here is organic and locally sourced  healthy and delicious so I am definitely going back for more!!

MEWEuKe_IfEoMb_mYXyQFQ,SGGHTu36g2f8x6AB_PyAhw,0.152263374486,4,Rarely do I find a workout that I actually enjoy. But the combination of music and cycling makes me look forward to attending classes at CYC Fitness.  If you are into fast paced  intense workouts  then CYC is for you. They claim that you burn upwards of 1 000 calories per class. Once you see how much they make you sweat  you will definitely believe that statement.  All the instructors that I've had have been fun. They are good at motivating you to stay strong through the whole class and push yourself until the end. Some of the instructors aren't as intense as others  so it's a good idea to go to different classes so you can get a feel for who you like best. There is nothing wrong with picking a favorite here  because no matter who your instructor is  you are going to sweat and be sore the next day.  The only downfall of CYC is the price. As a college student  it's hard for me to justify dropping $150 for only 10 classes. I'm hoping that as the company expands they will be able to lower prices for students. I have trouble staying motivated during workouts  but the group and music aspects of CYC help me get through a 45-minute class. The playlists are awesome and the workout is fun. Your first class is free  so I would definitely give CYC Fitness a try.

I was very surprised that the Wynn had a restaurant that didn't cost me and my date over $80.  I wouldn't say that the food they serve would be what I considered meals but they were definitely hefty portions of snacks. (e.g. meat ball sandwich  pasta  etc.).  My favorite dish I ordered here was the truffle fries.  MMMMMM YUMM.  I haven't been to many restaurants that offer truffle fries  so I was very pleased.  My meal was a meatball sandwich which at first when I ordered I expected to be plain and ordinary.  This was not the case at all.  The house prepared meatballs were also very good when we visited.  I'm not quite sure that the menu is still the same now but I would expect that their new options are just as savory.  If you also just need a place to unwind after a long weekend on the strip  this place is quiet and small.

I live in the neighborhood  so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!  I wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza well done and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami  Mortadella  Ham  Melted Mozzarella  Lettuce  Tomato  Italian Dressing  $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly fell out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty  but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup  but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=Iqzb-H48B0AgB0vX-tKhDg  Next I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now  I'll give it 3 Stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=xHoP8sxg9hyWexhiY6x52A  The employees are really friendly too and I think it's family owned  which I love.  Overall  the joint gets 3 Stars and the Pizza will definitely get a 2nd try from me.  Return Factor - 80%

I settled on the muffaletta sandwich and the fish and chips to take home for me  my wife  and our little one to share.  The muffaletta was pretty good  but it was made into a pressed panini-tye of sandwich.  I'm still looking for a good NOLA Central Grocer style muffaletta up north (north of NOLA  that is) and so far Jason's Deli comes the closest.  But still  the Herban Legend version was a tasty sandwich.  The fish and chips  on the other hand  were awesome.  Probably the best I've had in Charlotte  and that includes the Crepe Cellar.  In addition  the people running the truck were very friendly and cool  and were willing to recommend their favorite dishes  which always helps (don't you hate it when the staff at a restaurant are ambivalent about the menu choices?).  I'm looking forward to trying this truck again before too long.
qMChQyJYhFsgQ1ZI3ZAasA,myck1Tde_kSBGZWtS3IcHA,0.111405835544,3,I've been to Natt Spil a few times and had pretty similar experiences each time. It's very busy on the weekends  but my most recent trip was on a Monday night with a group of 7 for dinner.   The ambiance is funky and hipsterish. I like it generally  but it was too dark and the music was too loud for a Monday night. On a weekend night I expect this  but it was 7pm on a Monday and we wanted to hear each other. I have also never been to Natt Spil and had enough room. Even on a fairly un-crowded Monday night  the 7 of us were crowded at a table that could comfortably seat 5.   Our server was attentive even though we were nestled back near the DJ. The food is pretty good. On Mondays you get a pizza and a pitcher for $16  which is a good deal  and we got 4 of these specials at our table  sampling 3 different pizzas  all of which were good. My husband had been excited about the mussels  which they didn't have that night. Salads were hit or miss  and the shu mai wasn't popular with a couple in our group  although my husband liked it.  The weirdest thing was that the beer wasn't very cold. We got 4 pitchers of 3 different types of beer. At least 2 of the beers were warm. In the past  I've ordered a bottle of wine that also came warm. It was red wine  which is still supposed to be served colder than room temperature  but it was definitely warmer than room temp. Disappointing because they have a pretty good wine list. Although they have a rotating beer list  I wasn't too impressed with their choices. It would be so easy to pick more popular or more exciting beers.   I know lots of people who love Natt Spil  but I am still not sold. With so many better options with more light  more space  and better food  I'm not sure I see the point. I would probably return for the pizza and pitcher special  for late night drinks or food  but not for dinner on a random night of the week.

I've tried Famous Dave's  Memphis BBQ  and even Tc's ( which I'm not that happy with).   The service is great  walking in  the host is hilarious. The owner makes you feel at home  and wanting to come back. It wasn't that busy when I came in on a Thursday afternoon. They have a lunch special right now  if you buy a lunch meal  you get another free.  Let's get to the food part. The beef brisket was moist  and pulled pork melted in my mouth. Everything had that smokey bbq appeal  not greasy like certain places. The mac and cheese was on point  no so cheesey but creamy. I will definitely go back to this place :)

I'm no oyster connoisseur but I would imagine a live worm is unacceptable? It was still wiggling on the edge of the oyster shell. I'm guessing that means it's as fresh as can be? Another thing to note is most of the oyster shells didn't look like there was any attempt to clean or scrub them before opening as they had dirt and grime all over it. All management offered was a refund on the oysters  and gave us 3 of their premium and cleanest oysters that they had to offer. I felt like our entire meal should have been comp'ed. Other people in our party a variety of tacos and everyone agreed that they wasn't anything special about them. Midway through our meal  they dimmed the lights and turned on some club music  but there wasn't enough people in the bar/restaurant for that type of ambience. All in all  it is an overpriced restaurant that I think is still trying to find its identity  and please make sure you don't give people worms!

When we got our meal  instead of a different veggie  there was none  essentially her (tiny) steak and a serving of potatos  and that was it.  The bad part was that the waitress never bothered to ask if that was ok  just brought the food and said that they preferred not to make the onions since we said we wanted something else!  Overall  an extremely disappointing experience...too bad too  because our last visit was great.

This is a great thing and a not so great thing  depending on what you're looking for. In a rush? Awesome. Looking to be pampered and relax for a bit? Go somewhere else. My massage chair kept shutting off after 2 seconds  the lady did not rub my feet AT ALL  but she did a good job however. I'd definitely recommend the place.
nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw,kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ,0.13025210084,5,I hadn't checked Yelp before going here  but it's on the light rail and I've been wanting to eat here for weeks. It just so happened that I was split between two offices today and Blue Fin was in the middle. So  I exited off McDowell and was treated to the amazing aromas of BF.   Upon entering  I'm greeted by the nicest lady I might have ever met. She admires my plaid jacket. (BTW  there's a Yelp sticker on the door!) After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice. That wonderfully kind lady was sad to see me leave because she wouldn't get to see if I liked my food. Waiting at the LR station  I was glad I picked up an extra pair of chop sticks because some crazy-eyed man was looking at my bag. Although it had been about 10 minutes from the time I received my food to the time I walked back into my office  the food hadn't really cooled down all that much. Nice! The fish was super crispy on the outside yet marvelously moist inside. And the rice was good too.   I'll definitely be back  kind lady. And hopefully I'll be able to eat there with you so you know how much I appreciate great food and expectational service.

My sister and I went for some good old fashioned liquid dessert  aka Key Lime Pie martinis. We also shared the cheese plate: warm Fontina fondue  along with aged goat  blue  cheddar and gouda cheeses  and the Shitaki Ravioli  which featured a really nice Foie Gras sauce -- yum!  Note that they're currently undergoing construction due to expansion; we ended up perched on stools at the bar next to a very large tarp  but didn't notice any noise or drafty conditions. And yes  as some other reviewers mentioned  the strip mall location is somewhat disconcerting  but two drinks in you'll forget all about the neighboring Jiffy-Lube.

RSExP0-Boucr4QyIEzZi0A,y2eo_MWD3XfnxxvhXh7Esw,0.0860215053763,5,I was so stoked to finally stop over here for an event this weekend because I knew I would love it. I've been enjoying their whiskeys ever since they opened a few years ago  but I've never been able to stop in to the distillery until now. I have been pleasantly surprised by how involved Wiggle is in the community and how many events it participates in: I've probably been to half a dozen events (some of them Yelp events) where young and peppy Wiggle reps are there promoting their goods.  From a subjective standpoint  I really enjoy the generally younger staff who know how to network and showcase the company's incredible products. And boy are the products good. I wouldn't consider myself a whiskey connoisseur by any means  but I do enjoy a nice clean glass once in a while. And after trying many of their products at the sampling on Friday (ryes  wheats  malts  and gins (!)  oh my!)  I definitely will be purchasing Wiggle's products for my whiskey (and sometimes gin) needs in the future.

Seriously  can't a girl get a little room to dance? Alas  I'm restricted to awkwardly wobbling around as I try to dodge the overly-persistent drunk creepies you let in.  It's just always too danged crowded here.  On top of that  you still have the nerve to  charge my guy friends cover even though the club is already way over capacity.   It's okay though  I forgive you  only because you made amends last time by giving my girlfriends and me each a pair of awesomely-comfy flip-flops as we exited the club.  Best. Idea. EVER. My feet and I thank you.  I award you one extra star just for that. I would give another star (really  the free flip flop thing is that great)  but that would bump your rating up to 4 stars  and then you'd start getting ideas thinking you're a hot-shot vegas club or something.

VJYOi_2Uc8-ijfyf1DtBUQ,4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ,0.0897435897436,3,The food was pretty good; service unfortunately was not as satisfactory.  We arrived at 8:28 pm for an 8:30 reservation.  The hostess snottily told us that she would seat us closer to our reservation time and handed us a beeper.  Two minutes later it went off  and we were seated.  We were a bit taken aback by this  and there were several other similar incidents.  I'm not sure where the haughty attitude comes from.  The restaurant has an extensive gluten-free menu  which was a real plus for my friend.  The entire table shared the gluten free smoked salmon appetizer  and it was quite good  including the bread.  I had the filet mignon merlot with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly  and the sauce is really exceptional.  I kept eating the potatoes even after feeling full just to finish the sauce.  Overall  a decent experience due to the food.

HvaVgP0S0dFaCbBDIQIkag,ItMihRR-t810HgctGofF3g,0.10071942446,3,This is a great place for people who are tired of analyzing menus for hidden allergens because they have food sensitivities. It is not  however  a great restaurant for people who are looking for a great meal in general.   It fills a niche  but if you're not in that niche  it is solidly mediocre.  We tried Nourish last night for dinner. Overall  the ambience is lovely  with the surrounding Optima landscaping sending wafts of perfumed air down onto the comfortable patio.   I think there was only one server  and he did a fine job  but we would have appreciated quicker service  since we were trying to get to Tempe for a show and informed him of that at the outset.   The food was good with an asterisk. As mentioned above  if you're used to not being able to eat anything on a menu because of food issues  this place is probably a Godsend. However  none of us has allergies and we all felt that our menu items were OK at best  and downright bland in some cases. There was simply nothing that stood out as amazing  or even memorable.   Finally  I have to make a comment on the dinnerware. The plates were very cute and obviously chosen by someone with an eye for design. The same can be said for the general decor of the restaurant and the furniture. So why  I ask  were we given flatware of similar quality to the local elementary school cafeteria? You know  the kind you'll find wrapped in a paper napkin at the hole-in-the-wall Mexican dive that you can bend with one hand. The kind that has forks whose tines are practically in the same plane as the handle and are almost always slightly bent so that you get that uncomfortable sensation of biting a tine that you didn't expect to be so close to your teeth...  I was actually really perplexed by this phenomenon  in case you hadn't noticed. Also  some people at our table had forks that didn't even match the rest (but equally poor quality.) The only thing I can think of is that they were trying to continue to the general theme of recycling/reusing/employing good karma practices  and they've repurposed the flatware from a kid's play-set or something.   Probably won't be back. Sorry  Nourish  I applaud your efforts and the spirit of your endeavor  but you just didn't wow me.

I felt a little bit weird about the whole idea of lions in a habitat in the casino  but I felt much better when I learned that it's super-fancy so it's perfect temperature/clean air  they don't hear or smell us  and that the ranch that they're coming from has a lot of lions so each lion is only there for about 5 hours a week. Not sure how much they like being loaded up and transported  but.... it made me feel better.  The first time they were sleeping (which apparently they do 18-20 hours a day  especially when in a comfortable place) and/or being lazy  but the second time I was happy to see one awake and moving around.  I love how they seem to enjoy laying on the see-through(ish) portion where the walkway for the humans is. It's pretty crazy to be standing right under a resting lion!

Ly72PZoHkGZUVWgLH8W2-A,qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA,0.0283018867925,2,Prix Fixe Event Review:  We chose P.J. Clarke's to host a family member's 100th birthday.  As there were  roughly 50 people attending  we chose to do a prix fixe menu in the Sidecar room.  We chose a $45 per head menu that included soup  salad  entree  4 family-style sides and dessert.  From the beginning  there were glitches.  We called the restaurant several (4) times to set up an appointment to discuss the menu.  No returned calls despite direct promises to call us back.  At that point  we started to reconsider our choice.  However  we finally set something up and had our menu appointment.  The staff was very apologetic but  still  not a good start.  The day of the event  the restaurant was really welcoming and let us set up in the room prior to the event.  It was great having that flexibility  we didn't feel pressured to get in and out.  Unfortunately  when the dinner started  so did the problems.  The main problem was that they understaffed the event.  There were 2-4 servers working the event  but most were just bringing out the food.  It was really hard to get refills  silverware  etc.  During dinner  the tomato soup  which  per the contract  was to include grilled cheese toast  did not arrive at the tables with the toast.  We asked the waitress about it and she said  with a bit of attitude  no one told me that it was supposed to come with the soup. It was clearly on the menus sitting at every table.  So  we had to then flag down the night manager who apologized and handed out toast to everyone (she was really nice and helpful). Sadly  most people had finished their soup at that point.   Then  they brought out the salads.  Many of them didn't have salad dressing and  once again  waiters had to be flagged down. Next  they brought the entrees  but didn't provide steak knives for the skirt steak.  Basic necessities were hard to come by for this meal.  The family-style sides were really laughable though.  To my table of 10  they brought 20 tater tots to share  two tiny pots of mushrooms  and14 asparagus spears.  They  once again  forgot the french fries  and when those finally arrived  it consisted of roughly two-four handfuls for the table.  Really stingy  in my opinion.  I would have preferred larger portions of just two sides.  The dessert consisted of cheesecake and cobbler.  Two slices of each per 10 person table. Yeah......  I really like the sidecar room and think it's a great spot to host an event.  My main concern with this event was the service or lack thereof.  It was really stressful to keep running around  hunting down staff  to fix basic issues like issuing silverware and providing salad dressing.  Also  some of the staff weren't very friendly at times and I saw one of them giving unwarranted attitude to one of the elderly guests.  The bartender  however  was awesome and really nice to everyone.  Overall  the food was good but the service was lacking.  I would probably return  but only for a small dinner.

BFzp34CongI8FAnFrC4WNA,tLvaZcQ1BvgSyA8KU2qgxw,0.119760479042,5,Awesome! Don't miss this restaurant.  The food is exceptional; the hummus is the best I've had outside of the middle east. The meat is always fresh and well cooked. If you're on a date  the two person mixed meat combo is a good choice to see what you like. If you're into Greek  their Gyros are always done perfectly  and their tzatziki is on point.  Prices are fair for dinner  low for lunch. I stop by at least once a week for the $6 gyro  fries  and drink combo.   They are a family run business  and every interaction I've had with the owner has been great. He really cares about the quality of his food and how his customers feel.  Yes  the decor is off. They obviously bought a defunct 5 'n Diner and turned it into the Flaming Kabob. It makes no difference to me  I'm sure in time they will redecorate or relocate. Either way  I'll be there.
o_hE7YEoqz_NqAzkLUenyg,nMHhuYan8e3cONo3PornJA,0.0419161676647,5,So I know what your thinking  Sushi in Arizona!?!?! YES!!!  I highly recommend checking at Nobuo at Teeter house! I honestly have to say this was the highlight of my trip with my husband. After having a disappointing lunch earlier that day  my husband and I wanted to have an awesome dinner. So I looked up online to find the best places to eat in Arizona and Nobuo was one of the restaurants that was suggested. We arrived on Saturday night at around 9. The restaurant is located at the historical Heritage Square in Phoenix. We had a little trouble trying to find the place since we aren't locals and drove around the block a few times before finding the parking structure.   Nobuo is located inside the Teeter house which was built in the 1899 and they converted into a  restaurant. I think this is what got my husband and I a little confused because we were actually looking for something that resembled a typical restaurant. I honestly felt like I was walking into a home because they had a front porch with chairs and the 3 separate small dining rooms. They were pretty much booked but we were able to quickly get seated at the bar. First off  I loved the atmosphere  everything was intimate and you can just feel the history of the place. Dinner option was tapas style so my husband and I ordered 4 items including dessert.  Seabass and Mushroom Pork Belly wrapped in Banana Leaf (highly recommend) Grapefruit and Hamachi House Cured Salmon (highly recommend)  Everything we ordered was delicious and I loved how chef Nobuo himself would come out and serve our meals explaining each plate to us. Surprisingly we were full with just these 4 dishes.   The service was impeccable and Chef Nobuo even came out and talked to my husband and I about the history of the place.   My husband and I can't wait for our next trip to Arizona to eat here again.

Never have they messed up an order  and it's always ready for pick up in exactly 10 minutes.   Decently priced. You get a good amount of food for price.   We have dined in a handful of times and the service is great and fast.   Give it a try if you're doubting!

c1Tvzzg0ZYr501NwiqWLRA,VDkeAfcoSR9SQP9AeEulag,0.0324825986079,1,If you are a renter  I'd steer clear of any place managed by this organization. The reason being  if you as a tenant call and request a copy of the CCNRs so that you are aware of the rules for the community you live in  they will not release those to you. I was directed to have my landlord call them and request that I was given a copy. Even after he told me that he had called to OK this  I got all kinds of excuses and never got a copy of the CCNRs. Meanwhile  I am getting ridiculous notices sent to me stating my potted plants and stainless steel garbage can do not fit the definition of patio furniture as stated in the CCNRS and I am therefore in violation. See where this is going?   Everyone who lives on property or even sets foot on the property should be able to get a copy of these rules whenever they want them. If there are rules and guidelines to live by then thats fine  but when you are policing people for not following the rules  then you wont tell them what the rules are - that is just plain stupid. I can see no reason why they do this and I could never get a straight answer from anyone in regards to why this policy was in place.   Renters were also not welcome at the community meetings. I think that the organization itself could do a better job at fostering positive relationships between homeowners  renters and management but my experience was that they just don't care.   It's really too bad since I loved where I lived. I couldn't take it anymore though and I moved. These people and these HOAs can really make your life hell if you get on their shitlist. I lived on this same property a few years prior to RMI taking over and never once heard a peep out of them or got any violations. My neighbors were super cool. I had a great relationship with people on all sides of me and aside from coming and going at odd hours (I work graveyard shifts) there was nothing that set me apart from anyone else who lived there. My landlord was pretty cool too but eventually he agreed that they were just picking on me and when the violations for things like my guest who was visiting for an afternoon was driving a car with expired tabs - give me a break -  when these sorts of violations were stacking up I'd had enough.
l9Zawl4rFmHk4cyXhVfW9w,3fA43apyr5i8PAm0Az04hQ,0.013986013986,2,This place is really more for the beer and wings crowd they pander to. On game night it is always packed  and service is unreasonably slow both at the tables and the bar.  The last time I was here was with my best friend  who had befriended the bartender and demanded that I tag along and enjoy the drinks that the two of the came up with. Well  us not caring about pop sport culture did not know it was a game night  and so struggled to find seats at the bar. Her friend the bartender took a while to get us our drinks  which was fine since he had to service the whole place. But then came the food fiasco. First  it took fifteen minutes for us to put in our order. Then it took twenty minutes for the order to go through. Which isn't all that bad considering  but the thing was  we only ordered appetizers. I got fried pickles and she got the sampler plate. I was approached by a waiter with two baskets of fried pickles who asked me if I had order some. I said yes  and they gave me a basket. Turns out the people next to us had ordered two baskets of fried pickles. I basically just jacked their pickles. I didn't know this until much  much  much later when my friend got her plate and they gave me another basket of fried pickles. The bill was only for one as well. I seriously hope those people didn't end up paying for two. Overall their burgers and wings aren't excellent  it's really the sauce and fifty TVs they have there that keep people coming.

They had a private room arranged with nice table settings  it was an intimate and classy event.  We were welcomed and started the wine tasting with the white wines and the fabulous chef Jennifer described each of the tastes she prepared for us.  I loved the scallops with the risotto  so delicious.  Then the red wines came with an assortment of beef tastings.  I loved them all.  Cannot decide which is my favorite.  I was so impressed that I texted my husband and we ended up having dinner there.  I needed more of the beef.  I am not a big beef eater  but I love when it is well prepared and they didn't disappoint.  Thank you  Lindsey and the entire staff at Capital Grill for hosting such a magnificent event.

I asked for a design so I guess the woman in the front does the designs  well she did a horrible job on the design. It looked a mess. A simple cheetah design and she wanted to charge me $5 for just a 2 color design (teal and silver) and when I asked for a black outline she tells me it's Art and she's been doing cheetahs for years so it'll be an extra $3 for all them colors. It still looked horrible and she seemed to get agitated finally she says if you don't like it she can take it off and she signals to the other manicurist. Her attitude was horrible and I would not recommend this nail shop.

Didn't beat In-N-Out  but I did find it more enjoyable than Five Guys.  The rest of the family has the shicken strips.  The were seasoned nicely  and decent size.  Everyone was happy.  The sides...fries were good; and while the onion rings were legit  the weren't seasoned enough.  I'd stick with just the fries next time.  Finally  the kids had milkshakes.  The plus is that they were real milkshakes.  Unfortunately  they were too milky & short on flavor.  $30 for a family of 4  including the milkshakes.  More than I'd like to spend for a quick dinner after baseball practice  but we all felt the food was good and everyone was full.  We'll certainly be back to give it another shot.

DO THE LUNCH BUFFET! so FLIPPIN good. lots of choices and everything is well made and to style. I love this place. I'm in love  I'm in love and I don't care who knows it.

5mHPtvzOpfT_FUp6F-AJKw,9N2tZ6Mf4wX-yghfszL_Lw,0.18,5,This place is great  I always find name brand stuff for CHEAP.  Treat yourself to something nice  if it's badly used I won't buy it.  But if it has a dingy smell and no stains & my size I buy it.  Sure you come across some trash but you have to look really hard to find name brand stuff.  I normally go to Dollar General and pick up Oxiclean ans wash it before I wear it.  Heck I'm wearing Timberland BOOTS (seemingly never worn) that I bought at THIS location for like 8 bucks.   $100 boots that I stumbled across  their scoffed now but I was happy to come across them LAST YEAR.  This place is just amazing  the staff are always friendly and helpful.  I usually shop here for good deals instead of walmart... atleast it goes to a good cause like helping people find work.

EWWiBuidTJtHGSYM21i9iQ,qn_JH7PPnJzwWkiAhadnsA,0.301204819277,5,I recently went with my family to this establishment.  We enjoyed a wonderful steak  very tender  I tried the potato pancakes which were great and loved the cream corn.  The atmosphere was western and rustic and fun.  It looked like all the fun happens outback with multiple picnic tables  campfires and a place for a live band.  I will certainly be taking more of my friends and family back to this place  which is also close to some beautiful views of the mountains.
uaV9RyaExa57uTkvrB__8Q,1qgy9kz5TQaTm-9qcoATwg,0.0473933649289,1,I won't eat here unless it's a last option.  I was next door at the Gun Store taking a class on Saturday. It's a 10 hour class and to keep the class going and get done we were told we could work thru lunch. We should go next door to this restaurant  get the order to go and come back and keep learning. Good plan!  While the plan was great this restaurant is not. No one working there looks remotely happy to see anyone. There was a man there who looked to be in good shape but just rude  short and generally unhappy. He never greeted anyone. He never made any eye contact. He took my order wrong and then acted like it was someone else's fault when I mentioned it. Here is a clue. When you make a $1.50 mistake you don't bill them for it. You comp it and move on. Just a hint. He seemed like he had better things to do.  The front door area smelled like a truck stop bathroom and they were trying to kill the smell of urine with perfume. Industrial strength perfume.   The menu is pretty normal fair and the food is average. Anyone reading this could order the same frozen crap from CISCO and make the same average food they are making without much fuss.   The other staff seemed to act just like the manager or owner guy. They all moped around and I would encourage them to find a place were life is happier and they end up working for people who care.  The dinning area looked like something out of 1970's Communist Russia. It was old  dirty and disgusting. The carpet has to be well over 30 years old and dirty as ever.   Frankly you would have thought they would have been happy with 15 take out orders at lunch. Take out is the good for sales. You don't give up any sitting space and your staff is not burdened with waiting on anyone  but that is not a problem there since there were only about 4 - 6 people eating there on a Saturday at lunch.  The clue there should have been that no one was eating during a weekend lunch. How this place stays open is amazing to me.  Over all I think a 1 star rating is still a bit high. They should look around and see what they are up against. This place should have been closed 10 years ago.

We sat the hibachi table  the cook was boring  no talent  what made it worse was the food was tasteless and boring. I used to frequent this establishment before it was sold about 3 years or so ago it was great then. After eating here recently  my extremities blew up  I was sick to my stomach and could not get focused for 2 days. I cannot even give this place 1 star. It was the worst I have ever been to  and the prices were way out of line for the terrible food and service. Panda Express does better then this restaurant. That is a very sad statement I must make.

J_9t5Ha4e2phiCYb8FQW0A,xyTJYlbE_MLouK6rCou6zg,0.146341463415,5,What can I say about this place that hasn't been said by 1500 other people? Hands down the best burger I've ever had in my life!  I've been here twice  and the first time I rated this as the 4th or 5th best burger in town. But the issue was that I got one of their pre-made selections on the left side of the menu. I think I got a Peppercorn burger or something  but it was a good not great experience.   The next time I got adventurous and made my own burger. When you mix a high quality meat with the bun/cheese/toppings that you like  this burger will blow your minds. It was a little more expensive with the high-quality beef  but worth every penny.  What's that  and they have a good beer selection?  Make-your-own milskshakes you say?  I only have good things to say about this place. Go here. Go here now.
ddrWxBP4ARIxn0Lu1plMWg,1vmi2_4Xd6iD58MeGp1FWA,-0.0394736842105,1,I had friend visit from out of town so I wanted to take her on a guided horseback tour. I made reservations with this company because I heard about it on Groupon. When I looked at the website  the Sunset Tour caught my eye so I called to book it. No one answered so I left a voicemail. I called in the early afternoon but no one returned my call until 10:00 am the following morning. I tried to book the Sunset Tour but all the lady said was we can't no legit reason but she offered us a tour at 2:00pm which was no big deal so I agreed.   On the day of our scheduled tour (which was about a week after I booked the reservation) I received a text message that read exactly like this Need TO cancel horse ride guide is sick I received this text at 11:58am when my tour was scheduled for 2:00pm. Not only was it unprofessional for this business to send a text  I was only given 2 hours notice. About 20 minutes later I received a voicemail saying that their horse rangler is sick so they must cancel and to call back to confirm we received this message. She did not apologize whatsoever.  I called about 30 times before I could get ahold of anyone. When someone finally answered  I asked if there was anyone else available to guide the tour because my friend was leaving the next day and she said no. Still she did not apologize. I explained to her how I thought it was inappropriate for her to send a text to cancel and she responded with well I asked you to call me back and when I told her I called about 30 times and no one answered she replied well I saw you beeping on the other line but I was on the phone booking other tours Her responses were contradicting and rude so I started yelling at her and only then did she start apologizing. At this point I was pissed so I hung up.   ZERO STARS for their unprofessionalism and rudeness but since yelp does not allow that I put one star. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone.

Knowing that a large group of us were going to meet here  I felt like a proud Texan to go somewhere with Texas in the name (I lived there for 7 years  how could I not get out without some pride?). However  this place would make Texas ashamed.   The space was great and they had a room reserved for our group. It provided a great intimate setting for us! The service was good.  The food was its downfall. The appetizers were average and seemed factory processed (you know  open the box type). The steak was dry  hard to chew  and salty...blah. For the price per entree  they should step up the quality.   Good night out with the group  great location...not a fan of the food.

Who knew a $2 taco could turn you into a cunning linguist? I don't know what it is about Tijuana street food but boy are we glad they set up shop here in Las Vegas! Tacos El Gordo... Go! Go there now! Holy mother of God that's a good taco!  As we Mexican food aficionados  we were more than thrilled to finally find some good grub here in Vegas. For a mere two dollars you can get carne asada tacos  tacos de cabeza  tacos de lengua  and our personal favorite  tacos adobada (spicy pork). When you walk through the door you will immediately be greeted by the beautiful adobada roasting on a spit. Now really. Who doesn't like beautiful pork spinning about on a spit?  Warning! Don't be distracted by the $10 fries! This is a distraction for gringos! Your mission is tacos  tortas  sopes  and more tacos! All much cheaper than the gringo fries and much more delicious! So get in your car and get your ass to Tacos El Gordo!

tCNt0WFUwqNC997W7kk3Ew,ocCzxkuTYjUtujlMLlEE3g,0.0862068965517,4,I admit I was a bit hesitant to go here because of the outside facade.  With the words 24 hours and gaming and location in a strip mall  I questioned the quality of the food.  My friend took me here because she raved about the sushi and customer service.  The sushi was excellent -- fresh and generous portions.  I particularly liked the sake sea bass and chicken mu shu.  (They offer a diverse menu of Asian cuisine by the way.)  Since it's 24 hours  it's great for anyone who may be craving good food during the wee hours of the morning.  Yep  one should not judge a book (or restaurant) by it's cover.

Only Buca di Beppo has managed to do that  and they did it by drowning the pasta in salt and charging through the nose for it.  The food here is pretty darn good.  I love the bread they bring to your table and the atmosphere is very fun.  My problem is that the past four times I've been here  the service was awful.  Tonight our waiter brought our bread and salads before our drinks and this was only a huge problem bc I was dying of thirst.    Our waiter (Vincent) had 3 tables.  It was like he was trained not to bring our table anything unless hte other two tables needed something.  He would disappear for 20 minutes at a time (I'm not kidding).  I gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order.  He came out with entrees for the one table  salads for the other  and bread for our table.  Why would you not just get our drinks?  You can come back to the table multiple times!!!  This has happened the past four times I dined here  and I'm just over the awful service.  Too bad I won't be back  bc I wanted to love this restaurant.  Good food  AWFUL service.  2 stars bc I love carbs so damn much.

If it wasn't for the horrible soup they give you in the beginning  I would give it five stars. My friend also fell in love as well.  She got the Spicy Eggplant that she said was the best she ever had at a Thai Restaurant.  My drunken noodles with veggies and chicken was also very tasty.  I even liked their spring rolls and rice. I actually liked the mediocre service that they gave.  They didn't hound me for anything anddidn't ask if my food was good when my mouth was full of food.  They were always available if I needed anything though  which I thought was important.  The first time I went there a few months ago  I wasn't impressed.  I am so happy that I went there again.  I will be coming back.

Having gone to Fogo when it first opened  I really wanted to go again.  First  when we got there. We sat immediately. We also had meats en route to us not 30 seconds later. This was very nice.  Sadly  our drink orders were forgot about. Along with that  all the meats were very bland and were nothing special. 50 dollars a plate was about 35 dollars too much.   I have even been to the Fogo De Chao in Las Vegas. That restaurant was far superior to this one. I feel like they just don't care as much at this location.

Everybody I have taken to Crazy Jims feels the same way. This is a greek restaurant  but they offer a variety of food. Their salads are great (their chicken caesar is my absolute favorite). They also offer pasta and pizza  both great! The chicken feta pita is my most recent discovery that is amazing  instead of onions I have ordered cucumbers in this pizza  om nom nom!! The lunch rush does get fairly busy  but they have a parking attendant to help out in the lot. They also make the best pita bread i have ever had!
fTErEJCSrz44r07lh2JFjA,zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg,0.116,4,After a day of partying out by the pool and then walking through the smoldering hot strip to get to the Cosmopolitan  I was about ready to down a pitcher of water  but I restrained myself so I could eat more of the deliciousness that lay before me.  We came for Sunday dinner at 5:30 and there wasn't much of a wait luckily.  $35 for dinner is reasonable to me since it is Vegas and the food is gourmet.  And we spent about 2 and 1/2 hours there  so I feel like we got our money's worth.  I like the little pots that everything is served in because not only are they super cute  but they prevent people like me from taking more than they can eat.  Plus  I get to feel like a tasting judge on Iron Chef.  They have gelato at the dessert station which is cool.  Pistashio is pretty yummy.  The build-your-own strawberry shortcakes were good too.  They also have a made-to-order mac n cheese station! I made one with shrimp  bacon  tomatoes  white and yellow cheeses.  So gooey  cheesy and delicious!  Too rich to eat it all  but worth a try!    My only complaints were that they serve dinky little snow crab legs instead of king crab and they didn't have creme brulee.  If you're one of those that come to buffets and gorge on the crab legs  this might not be the place for you.
D0A3EpY9OxuGE4bVqw-jmQ,ETnU0pf3aFuZfpHEHWyd4A,0.104395604396,4,Overall  I thought this place was pretty decent. I was in Vegas with my husband and 2 small children (yes Vegas can be family friendly!).  We enjoyed some fun with the kids at the circus shows and games and then ate lunch at Rock $ Rita's. We hadn't eaten any BBQ while on our trip  so we gave this a shot. I wouldn't say this is a great place for real BBQ  but the food was decent enough. I ordered the 1/2 chicken with garlic mash potatoes and onion straws. I asked for extra BBQ sauce for my chicken and onion straws. Once I poured some on each  they tasted just fine!  My hubby ordered the slider combo plate that came with 4 different sliders and fries.  My daughter (3 years old)  strangely  ordered the fish sticks and fries and she enjoyed them.  The draw that really got us in was BOGO FREE margaritas. They were actually pretty strong.  In closing - this place was pretty good! I can't speak for the other restaurants inside Circus Circus.

D6PxfJsBrrbAUSY3Rxf_CA,vrHBeCEJLqz5MhmPERVg9A,0.00261780104712,3,I've had mixed experiences with this location as far as customer service goes. The first time I came in for some orchid food  herbs for potting and some soil. I grabbed a big bag of soil  I think 20 lbs and set it on the counter in their outdoor section. I inquired about the orchid food  and the cashier had no idea what I was talking about. Maybe a language barrier? A fellow customer overhears after I repeated myself for the third time  and takes me over the orchid food  which was very sweet of him. I grab it and head back to the register  and the cashier announces that she just closed. Could she not have mentioned that she was closing in 2 minutes when I set down the 20 lb bag of soil? Or waited for me to come back with the orchid food before closing?  I then have to tote this giant bag with my other soon-to-be purchases  for which I didn't grab a cart  all the way across the store. Home Depots are really big  and I am a small person- tall but small. I have spaghetti arms  thin  noodley  limp. The lady at the register didn't offer to get me a cart or anything. So I carried it all the way there. Poor customer service.  However  on my most recent trip  I went in for light bulbs. With two burnt out in the bathroom  I feared bats were going to being occupying the space  so I finally made my way back here to fix the problem. On this occasion  I was offered help finding light bulbs by three different people  only two of which worked there. So  spot on with that and being able to answer all of my questions about LEDs and light saving options.  It might just be the garden department that is grumpy. That department is definitely lacking as far as stock goes as well. Compared with other Home Depots  their garden section is pretty sparse with some interesting selections in plants seeing as how the majority of their selection can't withstand the desert. If someone has successfully grown gardenias and they've bloomed in the desert without the buds falling off  I salute your insanely green thumb!

Yes  the place is very clean and has an enormous selection of polishes.  But that's where it ends.  My nail tech spoke barely one word of English.  Another tech had to speak with her in their native language to guide her.  My pedicure was very good; the chair cumfy and her massage wonderful.  But  oh  what an awful manicure!  I left there with no two nails shaped the same  and with polish coming off (even though I sat under the dryer).  My cuticles were butchered!  And when she was doing the manicure  her feet were touching mine in a way that caused the toe polish to smear off on several nails; she had to redo them.  I have never had an experience like this  nor do I want to again!

My colleagues and I sat at our table all at the same time and I was Completely ignored.    No one took my order  even though I was the only person at my table with my menu still in front of me.  I asked the staff 3 times if someone could take my order and I was still ignored.  Three courses were served And still no one came to take my order.  Finally when a server stopped by I asked if he could take my order and he laughed at me.  I didn't find this funny especially since entrees were the next course.  My wine glass was never refilled  and my water glass was filled only once.  Towards the end of our evening instead of asking to box our food  they literally dropped To Go boxes and Bags on the center of the table.  Guess what? I'm INDUSTRY and work for one of your competitors  even though my career is medical.  That was RIDICULOUS!  I know how many Millions your restaurant makes yearly---I know howuch your staff makes per shift  per week and yearly.  This was a joke---totally Old Town Scottsdale Trash.

It's really fun to discover somewhere new and amazing!  Staff was nice and giggly too---

I stopped by for lunch with my wife right when they opened before we checked into Encore.  The Ramen was very good.  The broth was was excellent.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  There was also plenty of meat along with the rest of this Japanese Goodness.  I will definitely be back whenever I am in Vegas.  Definitely worth any sort of wait.

The drive through was backed up with several cars  so I walked in to order some smoothies. I did not receive a receipt because something was wrong with the machine. It took nearly 15 minutes to complete my order and a few customers who ordered AFTER me were served BEFORE me!  Needless to say  the smoothie tasted like a three year old took a bunch of fruit dropped from the ground and mashed it together with their hands.  I explained to the manager on duty my disappointment and asked for a refund. I will never return to this location.

Two employees behind the counter and manager sitting at his desk with his back toward his customers  it was not busy we arrived at 5 pm on a Sunday.  There was one table with three people having drinks. We ordered our food at the counter- different. I used the facilities before our dinner came. No paper towels in paper towel holder the floor was dirty bits of paper scattered throughout the bathroom floor  looks like the bathroom area  had not been cleaned in quite a while.  The lobby was just a dirty as the bathroom. One emplyee did come out to empty out the trash can in the lobby however was called back to the counter for what ever reason the trash can sat in the lobby filled with trash for 10 minutes  one emplyee did walk thru the lobby noticed the trash and walked right by it not once but twice! Finally the original person who started taking out the trash came back to finish the job. Not once did the manager walk thru the lobby  to see if it was tidy. Two thumbs down will not be retuning back to this Johnny Rockets. Aside from being dirty the burgers where good the onion rings not good a disappointment. Also did not like how they brought out our french fries and onion rings first then later brought out our burgers.
57oSAPCW3eQNszqO2eNlzw,Fpml3mxXOznU7c0Zo-lxwQ,-0.0267558528428,1,Completely awful.   The scheduling was all messed up and they forced us to start early  which I am not holding against them in this review. They claim to have fired the person who caused this error.  We had a 1600 sq. ft. condo and just two people worth of stuff; no kids. Everything was already boxed  including the garage. Just move the boxes and the furniture to the truck  drive the truck from point A to point B  and unload the truck.  The first crew that arrived just after 11:00 and did nothing but load 2/3 of the garage for the first hour and a half while they waited for a second truck because apparently we have too much stuff to fit in just one. I still got charged for this time. After 5 hours total at our old house  the moving company claimed they wanted to send a second crew of two guys out to make sure that the original two guys finished before 20:00. Now I have to pay for two crews worth of time. The second crew arrived and helped finish the master bedroom and we were finally loaded and moved on to the new house.  At the new house  all four guys took another 3 hours to unload all the furniture and put it in the proper rooms.  The wife was quite hungry and left for the new house ahead of me leaving the old house  and she got pizza for us and another for the movers. When we arrived at the new house  the movers spent 45 minutes eating pizza and standing around our kitchen talking about football. I didn't say anything at the time because I was hungry and eating as well  and I expected they wouldn't charge me for this time. WRONG. They charged me for the nearly full hour they spent eating my food.   After over 8 full hours  three trucks (two of them 2/3 full and one completely empty) and two moving crews billed separately at the moving company's request we were finally moved. There was no damage done to any of our gear  and the movers themselves were quite pleasant. My biggest problem is that they moved slow and seemed to not care about time at the same time they were billing hourly. This is completely unacceptable.   The only issue I had with their treatment of my furniture is that they didn't care which way was right side up. They said we could leave our drawers full and they would just shrink-wrap them and move them in place  so that's exactly what we did. However because they were constantly moving them on edge or upside-down  all the things in the drawers ended up out of the drawers  so we had to physically remove the drawers  pick up all the jumbled contents of the drawers from the interior floor of the dresser  put the drawers back  and replace the contents of the drawers. This is worse than boxing it up and leaving the drawers empty!  I moved into this house in just over 3 hours for just under $400 with 2 movers. There is zero reason that four men took roughly 8 hours and cost more than 4\u00d7 the price. A friend of ours moved a 3800 sq. ft. house full of furniture with this company in less time  for less money  and with a single crew of 2!   I can not recommend against this company enough  regardless of how pleasant the actual movers were to deal with.

If my acid was that empty you better believe I would have at least straightened up the place.   Anyway I ordered the Mexican  sandwich (torta) with carne asada. My friend ordered a red chile tamale combo w rice and beans. We waited a few minutes and it was delivered to out table. My torta looked huge and was wrapped in sandwich paper I was happy about that.  My plate included the torta w a side of rice abs beans. I opened the torta and it had lettuce  tomatoes  jalape\u00f1os  and very little meat and was smeared with beans. It tasted ok so I squirted a large punt of salsa on it yo Mack the blandness. My sandwich (torta) was a high ratio of bread and very little meat.   My friend said her food was lukewarm but not hot. So this place is less than mediocre wily only recommend it if you are right there in the area and you really need to eat Mexican food.
PJaZF6J0drh2_eW0PWHvXg,FnHCN8B_jdD4ZaDk_6mX4Q,0.0566502463054,4,I'm not exactly sure when this location first opened  but some co-workers and I recently headed over to check out the Denny's at Neonopolis. In reality  I'm not a big fan of Denny's  but thought it'd be fun and kitschy.  The Good  It is the nicest  cleanest Denny's that I have ever been in. They have a full bar  which seems interesting for a Denny's  but then again  it's on Fremont Street and that makes sense. I can't comment on the bar because we went for lunch during the work week.  ('Nuff said.)   The restaurant has a photo booth that's Vegas-themed (NEAT); the kind where there's an outline for your head  you stand there  take the picture  and you'll come out with Elvis hair or whatnot. But the camera is kinda high  so if you're a scrimp like me (5' 1 or shorter)  the camera is too high. Sadly  my head didn't reach the outline  and there was no stool or anything like that.  We all had the french toast special  which was cheap ($6-7) and decent (or at least the french toast was; the sausage  . . . well  we won't talk about that). Our waitress told us that they're opening a wedding chapel (or already did)  and there was a celebrity wedding already lined up for February. (At least we're already in Vegas for betting purposes.)    The Bad  My group was seated in a booth adjacent to another booth  with some artsy-geometric bars as a separator from the head-up. As we were paying the bill  another co-worker and I turned around in the booth  and noticed a dude's head literally peering over our shoulders through the bars. Apparently  he was looking to see if we were done with our food. Kinda caught us off guard a bit.     The Ugly  It's still Denny's food. Okay / decent  but not great by any means. The general group consensus was that Denny's is a place to end up.  Overall  So why the four stars? Location  location  location! It's Denny's on Fremont  so it's worth checking out for that reason alone. Also  this restaurant has an outside patio  which will be a fun spot to people watch in the summertime  and offers uncommon Denny's menu items like flatbread."

"j7VdveS-AIA14jFys7uxnw","rLv5DPLnO67TCHIbbBWYPA",0.0126849894292,1,"My wife and I always heard good things about this place.  We were wanting to go to Tagliani's  but thought we should try Native New Yorker for once  to see what the hype was about.  We were sat quickly and the lady seemed pretty nice.  Unfortunately she rushed us through our decisions and never offered any helpful options or features/benefits.  Happy hour lists appetizers being half off  but that's only some of them  and conveniently  the three I was considering were those.  I understand there are small prints on deals at times so that could easily be overlooked.    The buffalo chicken dip appetizer we ordered was really good  but only worth $4 maybe $5 size-wise and could have been a lot better without the chunks of chicken.    My wife ordered the veggie calzone with pepperoncinis and mushrooms.  When this came out we were both impressed with the size  but the bread didn't have much flavor.  Along with this  recotta cheese was a very strange cheese to include being that its so grainy and overpowering.  It ruined the calzone for me altogether.    I ordered 18 wings on the bone.  6 suicide  6 hot  and 6 pineapple teriyaki.  The wings had a good amount of chicken  more than any other restaurant  but the sauces ruined it for me again.  I can handle a lot of heat so my opinion may differ from others.  The suicide sauce wasn't very hot  but there were so many red pepper seeds everywhere and they were actually pretty gross  unless doused in ranch.  I felt they tried so hard to make them hot  they ignored the taste factor altogether.  The hot wings were very good and decently spicy.  The pineapple teriyaki wings were ok  but seemed almost soggy because of possibly soaking the wings in the sauce for hours  absolutely doused.  I'm not sure which wings caused it  and I NEVER get heartburn  but I did here.    While we were waiting for the bill  we realized our server was the only serving the entire restaurant.  I understand this isn't her fault  but the restaurants.  The bill finally came  she had overcharged us for the calzone.  All minimal things that could be overlooked  but so many that it ruined the entire experience.    With waters and those meals the total was $30.20.  I tipped $5 and got the hell out of there.  Should have gone to Tagliani's.  I took the extra food home  not to waste  but it just sat there in fear of heartburn again.  If you go for drink and wings  I imagine it could be somewhat of an enjoyable scene being the bar top tables are all close and near the bar and there are tv's everywhere.    I would have given 2 stars  but my stomach hurts now."

The food is incredibly delicious and you get massive amounts for the money. I dont even think I could make it at home as cheaply as you can get it here.  We loved it so much the first time we came in that we returned a week later ready for some more. We picked it up and took it home and when we got there I found a long black hair in my food... no way it could have been my own hair (as my husband tried to convince me until he saw it himself). Hair in food just REALLY grosses me out.  That being said it was yummy enough that I'll probably be back in a few months. After I get over the hair."

But most egregious of all  I am sorry that I have lived in Arizona for 10 years and didn't try Sourdough Pizza Restaurant until about two months ago.  I have only ordered take out from here  so perhaps I should not review  but I suppose we'll just have to add this on to the list of regrets.  The Crazy chicken wasn't really crazy  but definitely still satisfying combination of mozzarella  cheddar  barbeque sauce  chicken  red onions  and mushrooms.  This was a touch sweeter than we would've liked but the chicken stood out.  The Pizza Blanco was a simply olive oil  ricotta  mozzarella  garlic and choice of two toppings  which we decided to be bell pepper and onion.  This was an outstanding pie with each bite being a perfect proportion of cheese  topping  and dough.  Speaking of which the sourdough was an excellent foil for both pizzas  absorbing the flavors well and getting to that savory  slightly fatty satisfaction in the interior but not greasy in the least on the exterior.

Don't get me wrong  the food is pretty good  but what you're paying for is the privilege of dining on the Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Sunday brunch was crowded but we were smart enough to make reservations on our way down there.  The outdoor patio is the best spot to dine and if you can't get a seat out there  the space just inside isn't bad. It's like a green house -- light and airy with plenty of windows. Further inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes as the space is darker and more intimate. That might be ideal for dinner  but during the day your best bet is the patio.  The cream of mussel and saffron soup was decent but the prominent seafood flavor made it obvious that it wasn't made with the freshest ingredients. The brie and butternut squash quiche ($12.95) was a whole  round  individual-sized quiche. The flaky  crispy crust was the highlight of dish. Not wanting a dish that was too heavy  the lobster tartine ($17.95) was the way to go. Unfortunately  the creamy  citrus flavors dominated the taste of the dish.  The restaurant is family-friendly. Yes  they've got a kid's menu. The chicken fingers and fries ($6.95) come in a TV-dinner-style tray with three large  thickly coated pieces of chicken  apple slices  green beans  and ketchup. So  if you're looking for a somewhat upscale place with good food to bring the family  Mon Ami Gabi is a good bet. And  of course  if you're on a date  you can't beat the outdoor dining.  3.5 Stars"

In other words  thorough preflight planning.  I made my reservation through the website and received my confirmation right away. The free shuttle to the casinos runs at 10am  1pm  and 4 pm. You MUST call at least an hour prior to your arrival to confirm your shuttle ride. I called about two hrs ahead because that was what worked best.  Upon arrival  I was led to our tie down and offered a ride in. We decided to walk instead.  Checking in at the desk was quick and easy. Overnight without fuel is $15 for a single. Our shuttle driver was actually a Towncar Limo and my wife and I were the only riders  so the first class treatment was appreciated. I tipped the driver $15 and he seemed genuinely thankful.  This morning on the way home  I paid the tie down fee  we were offered free bottles of water and a ride out. But before we did that  we went upstairs to the Landings for a nice breakfast. After breakfast  we were on our way with zero hassles. So 5 stars were earned..  For you pilot types  I don't know understand some of the negative overtones about ATC and operating around the Class Bravo. I didn't know how the Bravo would affect my flight but after a few minutes of looking at a paper chart ( old school  I know) it became obvious that if you're coming from anywhere in SoCal  make sure you're under 8000 and on an easy descent starting at 23NM from the KLAS VOR. Contact approach on 125.9 and just tell them what you want to do. Easy peasey.... On your way out  ask for flight following so you can climb pretty much unrestricted. The terrain and traffic in the area does require you to pay attention as there is a lot going on.. But I had no problems with ATC in the Las Vegas area or with the tower at Henderson. So they get 5 stars as well even if you can't Yelp them. Overall  a great experience and this little gem of an airport and customer service beats the hell out of the abuse you get by flying into McCarren."

I chanced upon it while browsing Yelp for Madison restaurants that took reservations. We had a party of 9 and looked up pictures online to see if the place could accommodate such a large group. I was initially wary but went ahead and made a reservation for 9. The manager reassured me through the phone that they are able to sit up to 10 people comfortably in their back room/bar area and she was right.  The service from the beginning was great. We had Quinn who was very friendly and helpful. We started with an order of Gorgonzola Chips which were absolutely delicious. The serving size is definitely not meant for a group of 9 but it managed to keep us satisfied until our entrees arrived. Before dinner  I had my heart set on the Poor Man's Paella but once Quinn mentioned the scallop linguine special  I was sold. The scallops were huge and the linguine was very tasty. Other people in my group ordered the Clam Chowder  Cilantro Pesto Scallops  Sun Dried Tomato Pasta  Cioppino  Pork Tenderloin  Spot Burger and the Fish Fry special - all of which got rave reviews. When we were all getting our entrees  my friend who ordered the burger was approached by Quinn and told that his burger was dropped as it was being plated. Quinn was quick to offer him a glass of wine and a bowl of clam chowder on the house.  Since our group was out for my birthday dinner  I was told by Quinn that I had a choice of dessert on the house. He suggested the Salted Caramel Sundae and it didn't disappoint. I was expecting a small bowl of ice cream and instead got 5 large scoops drizzled in chocolate on top of a layer of pecans. It was the perfect size for our already satisfied group.  I couldn't have asked for anything better for my birthday dinner and I will surely be back for the Poor Man's Paella!"

It tasted fresh rather then cooked  freezed and thawed when ordered. Greek salad came on the side which was fresh as well.  Along with my entree also came pita and hummus. The hummus was quite tasty. Mmmmm...  Before leaving...I tried the Aphrodite's Cheesecake as I read it won a few food awards. It had a baklava bottom crust. Delicious! The cheesecake itself was rich and creamy.

Yes.

At first I thought it was going to be difficult as the waiter (server? - I gotta get the PC verbiage right) seemed a little high-strung. However  as the meal progressed he definitely became much more personable.  I like the simplicity of the menu and the simplicity of the preparations. I had the fish tacos - it was a little strange that the two tacos came in separate tin foil packages on the plate....did they steam them that way  or simply prepare them and then put them in there to keep them warm? A tad disconcerting. However  they were good - the fish was flavorful - I just would have liked a little more of whatever was on the fish inside the tacos-was it sauce? Was it avocado? Was it sour cream or crema? No idea  but just a smidge more would have been good. The rice that came with it was so good I actually ate it....which I normally don't do with regular mexican rice. Had a smidge of a sweetness to counterbalance the savory.  It also came with black beans. I confess I didn't try them because I was full. The portions are not huge - which I find to be a good thing - they're just right.  The chips are light.....not all that flavorful but fine. They are accompanied by 3 different salsas which are also fine. We ordered guacamole and it could have used a bit more flavor as well.  The desserts are absolutely worth ordering. The fried cinnamon ice cream is the clear winner. Seriously - corn flakes on the outside forming the nice  warm crunch through to the cold cinnamon inside was amazing. The flan was good. The chocolate tamale with mint chocolate chip ice cream was good for a choco-holic but if you're not that  go with the fried ice cream.  I'll come back when I'm in town with the folks again if they want Mexican food...."

Now  my kids are not always well-behaved but this particular time they were being really good!  My son decided he wanted to count the mints in the bowl (these are pre-wrapped mints  mind you). While I was trying on the rings that another saleswoman was showing me and just about to decide on which I was going to buy  the manager (?) swooped in and took the mints from my son! He was just counting them! He wasn't throwing them around  he was just occupying himself! This is after a couple of rude comments which just was the last straw.  I was so taken aback that I took the ring off and left. I can't support a business that would be so rude to my child! I'm really bummed because I REALLY wanted that ring but I had to walk away.

Everyone else ordered prime rib  which was a small cut  and had nothing fancy about the sides. Lastly  we ordered the ice cream: salted caramel. When they said Salted  they meant it! I think they forgot the caramel. Was really bad. They did take off the charge for both my raw chicken and the salt ice cream  but that left a bad taste in my mouth....literally. If you go---stick to happy hour or a late night drink and appetizer with friends! Those were decent--and the staff was very friendly."

I got excited browsing the extensive menu online and they say they're the best and worth the trip even to Summerlin for someone who is on the strip visiting  even. With that kind of bravado to declare yourself best  it at least had to be decent. A place with the word pies in it  how could it go wrong  right?   It's a bit out of the way  you have to go into Sun City golf course community and it's in their little shopping center. We got a cherry pie  for $9.49 and it's a rather big pie for the price which seemed like a plus  if it was good.   Unfortunately  this was like the grocery store bakery pie you can buy for $4. It had that same type of crust grocery store ones do  that doughy soft kind and not flaky and crunchy on top like a fresh made one. The BF was so disappointed he just pushed his bowl away and said he's not eating any of the pie left.   While it was the right amount of sweet  have you ever made a cherry pie out of canned cherries and the sugar syrup didn't get all the way into the cherry and you just get that tart canned juice flavor? I got a few cherries like that and it reminded me of a awful time I had a really bad gout attack and I sat there forcing myself to eat frozen and canned cherries because it's off cherry season. Bleh.   My conclusion is that it makes sense that this is in a senior area. I'm not trying to be disparaging towards all old folks  but my grandpa could eat a burnt steak and not really care. They have no sugar added (uses artificial sweeteners) pies and I'm sure it pleases some people to have that option. I don't do fake sweeteners usually so I am not limited to such handful of sugar free businesses. Even so  I know a few places that offer up some decent sugar free options.  I can't give this a positive rating....It was out of the way for a pie I threw in the garbage."

The interior is elegant with clean lines (which we all know I love) and a very friendly vibe. I knew I'd love it as soon as I saw it.  I've been here several times and have just loved it every time. I have no idea what the complaints are about because I rank this as a top spot for both dropping in for a drink as well as dinner.  Stopped in last night for my favorite beer  Chimay  and a little appetizer before heading out for the night. Ashley the beautiful bartender is sweet and engaging (and a fellow yelper!) and doesn't make you feel like you're one of many customers. I'll go back just for how nice she makes the bar experience.   While there at the bar I had the meatballs al forno  a favorite dish of mine  and they were perfection. They were half pork shoulder/half veal  I was told  and that definitely contributed to their supreme tenderness while the pork held them together perfectly. They were in a mildly spicy tomato sauce that was a perfect accompaniment. Really  really enjoyed these.  I've been here before and had the olive oil and bread and the pasta and pizza and I really  really  loved them. The service was excellent even at the busy  time of night that we went.   I went back again (had the meatballs AGAIN - still delicious!) and had the stuffed zucchini as well. It was the perfect size together for a small meal. The zucchini had a great flavor and I really liked the mozzarella topping. For dessert I had the tiramisu. Oh. Wow. I really loved the SUBTLE flavor of espresso. Sometimes you can get a tiramisu where the espresso just overpowers the other flavors but this was just right. It was a nice size and melted in my mouth. I highly recommend.

But don't be fooled  the crowd wasn't about to let anything stop it from having a blast.  The food selection definitely took a step up this year compared to prior years.  In addition to the generic stuff you would expect at a festival (hot dogs and fries)  also present were the city's new and creative street food trucks  such as Grumman 78 & the Nouveau Palais Winneburger."

They weren't amazing   either  but the delivery was fast and they were really friendly.  The chicken fried rice here was a little on the bland side  sadly. And the pork fried wontons are a no-go for us -- they're VERY greasy...very very and the meat inside has this funky taste to it. Almost tangy? Maybe too much soy or something.  The lo-mein was good  but oilier than I'm accustomed to (are you sensing a theme?)  The sweet n' sour chicken is decent -- white meat and your standard sweet n' sour sauce. They do have the good sense to put it on the side so your chicken doesn't arrive in flaccid hot pink blobs.  Now that I've tried Jasmine Express  I probably won't order from here again  as their same menu items were a bit better  but they're definitely not bad."
