# Analytics Demos
This repo contains some demos of applied analytics and data science. Some are in R and some are in Python. The 
demos are as follows:

**Customer Analytics:** This demonstrates examples of predicting customer churn (using a random forest) and customer segmenting (using
model-based clustering). Written in R.

**Recommendation Engine** This provides a from-scratch implementation of a music recommendation engine in Python.

**Yelp Star Prediction**: This demo predicts Yelp star ratings (1-5) using only the text reviews, and is written in R. As such it provides an 
example of several text analytics techniques as well as a model stack for prediction. This was trained on a large data set and 
so takes an hour or so to train from scratch. Accordingly, an R workspace with the pre-built model is also provided so the demo 
can be run immediately.

Additionally, here are a few notes for usage: 

1. For the Python-based demos, Anaconda Python is recommended since many analytics-based libraries
come set up. It is available here: [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

2. For the R-based demos, you will need to make sure the libraries used are installed. You can
determine which libraries you need by looking at the top of the code.
