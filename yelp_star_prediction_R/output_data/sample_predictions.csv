"I went here after having driven by for a while and I was really surprised by how good it was. I ordered the turkado which is turkey and avocado  with tomatoes  onions  cheese and mayo. I added creamy horseradish but could barely taste it and will not be doing so next time. But  the turkey was thick and flavorful and actually tasted like meat instead of other places (Subway) where the meat tastes like wet preservatives. I appreciate the generous amount of avocado they put on the sandwich  but I am really getting tired of sandwich shops saying avocado when really they mean smashed avocado spread. I like to know what I'm getting  you know? Anyway I will be back but will be getting a half sandwich next time and no creamy horseradish.",1,1
"Went to this location today to get some cat food (had a coupon specific to Petco). This place was a mess. There was stuff everywhere. There were boxes in the middle of many of the aisles...we couldn't even reach some items due to the amount of stuff everywhere. Things are hard to find here  their order makes no sense. We walked around in circles trying to find the food we wanted (is it in the natural section...no... with the other Science Diet stuff....no.... oh in a random other aisle...yup).  If I can help it  I won't come to this location again.",1,1
"I think as far as the food is concerned  Joyride deserves 5 stars. I had two of the carne asada tacos and one of the carnitas tacos. The carne asada tacos were among the best I've had. So tasty  such flavor  wow!  The carnitas taco was also super good. I ordered a side of the habanero salsa and while it was not as hot as I was hoping for  it had a lot of flavor to go along with the heat. Don't let the fact that it contains habanero peppers scare you off  it is more than doable  even for the chili challenged. Maybe they should make a ghost pepper salsa.  My wife ordered a pair of the baja fish tacos. I must admit  even though I'm usually not a seafood person  the bite I had was also tasty. If you like horchata  do yourself a favor and try their spiked horchata with amaretto. It's really good and the fresh ground cinnamon on top was a nice touch.  Overall  I'm looking forward to hitting this place again. I wish I could say that I would sample more of their offerings but I'm not one that likes to go off the reservation once I find something I like.  Only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because  we sat at the bar  and the staff was a lil slow in responding to empty drink glasses. Yes  a lil room for improvement but not a big deal. Give Joyride Taco Shop a shot!",5,5
"Ate here again the other night - always delicious food and decent service.  My only complaint is that the dessert selection isn't the greatest  although the other food is always outstanding  especially the potato chips.  Will return again with friends and family.",4,4
"Super yummy and they are willing to personalize their dishes for your taste. Super casual and the restaurant is really cute ! The servers also wear pajamas!:) ",2,1
"If you're looking to dine Vegas style  Joel Robuchon is the place to be.  We came here with 10 friends on the night before New Years Eve. While it's not the most adventurous meal of my life  it did delight me with all my favorites -- a black truffle trio  osetra caviar  foie gras  duck  Santa Barbara uni  etc... and an incredibly beautiful 3 course dessert.  It is culinary perfection in the most romantic setting. What more could you ask for? More Caviar? Well  you probably won't because their caviar portions are the most generous I've seen! Bonus points for them there.   I could describe the food  but if you're a foodie like me  you already know the drill -- The food is good so I will not describe every dish. You get everything that is absolutely delicious  cooked to perfection  and plated beautifully.  And the ambiance  while some may say is gaudy  is very thoughtful and there is much to appreciate about it. The walled garden in one room  a beautiful welcoming bar in another  etc.... there is much to appreciate about this place and Joel Robuchon's attention to detail.  However  a few things that needed improvement or felt a little strange:  1) One of the things I found tacky was the $15 water charge.  If you're charging over $800/person for the meal plus pairing  water charges should just be waived or just tacked onto the food charge. I see this as a terrible faux pas  especially for a three michelin star restaurant. 2) Someone was getting on-the-job training at our table. This would be OK but out of the three times I got up to use the restroom  I only found my napkin folded twice. 3) Joel Robuchon has a fantastic limo service where they pick you up in a limo to the restaurant... but it was not available during the holidays much to our large party's dismay. It would've been nice to know this when we booked our table. 4) The soft-boiled egg seemed more like a hard-boiled egg to me. It was cooked on a higher-temperature side of things. 5) The wait staff is not in sync (all plates put down at the same time  etc...) like they usually are at this level of dining.  The menu was about $600/person  and my boyfriend and I split the most basic wine pairing for $250. At that price point  it better be perfect. And it was. But perfection comes with a downside -- it's that I think Joel Robuchon played it very safe. If you're a hardcore foodie  I think you may find the menu slightly on the 'safe' side (and in that case try \u00e9 by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s).  But if you're here for the Vegas experience and want to try a solid 3-star menu with a fantastic ambiance  this is the place to go. Highly recommend. Definitely more of a 4.5 stars from me.",4,5
"The first time I ever tried Italian ice cream  and at first it tastes weird but then your taste buds love it!    The prices are horrible though! Small little cup for like eight bucks! I could have gotten a giant milkshake somewhere for that price.",5,4
"I stopped here a few years ago to buy some jeans... at the time  this location was carrying 7 for All Mankind  which was a pleasant surprise.  I remember going in  browsing the selection  buying a pair of jeans and leaving without much effort.  Fast-forward four years...  I enter the store and am greeted immediately by someone who is eager to help.  I ask if they have any 7 for All Mankind and am told they don't carry that line any longer  but they do have several other brands  and they're all on sale.  Since I was already there (and because I have a quality denim addiction) I decided to browse.  Only  I couldn't browse.  No sir; I was swarmed by three - count 'em - three sales people the entire time.  Now  they were all very helpful  but it's a bit unnerving to have three people following you around showing you jean after jean after jean  asking questions  asking if you need anything else like shirts  sweaters  sport coats  ties  socks  shoes  etc.    I decided to try on a few pair; why they thought I'd like skinny jeans is beyond me... each pair I tried was so tight in the leg (I ride bikes  run  and swim) that I couldn't fit a few of them past my knee.    I mentioned this several times  yet each subsequent pair they presented was skinny cut.  I finally asked for a traditional or relaxed jean  and wouldn't you know it  but I could actually pull them up past my knees.  I settled on a single pair of (mediocre; pedestrian quality) jeans  which weren't on sale  but oh well.  The thing that irked me the most was the checkout process... Would you like to join our rewards club?    Me: No thanks.  I shop here about once a year.  Them: It's free and you earn points with each purchase.  Why don't you try it?  Me: No thanks.  Them: Ok  can we get your name?  Me: (tell them my name)  Them: Oh  you're in our system!  You must have rented here before?  Ok  well  we'll just add you to the rewards club  and then you'll be all set.  Are you still at this address?  And is this your phone number?  And is this your e-mail?  Me: Not interested  please don't register me.  And  yes - that info is correct  but please don't sign me up.  Them: Ok  here you go - oh  wait - your e-mail shows as invalid.  Are you sure this is your e-mail address?  Me: I really don't want to get any of your e-mail or mailings.  Them: Ok  we'll just override the verification.  Ok  you're all set!  I arrived home  checked my receipt and I'll be danged if they didn't register me for their stupid Perfect Fit program.  Worse yet  I received a welcome to the club e-mail from good 'ole George Zimmer himself.  Never again  George Zimmer.  Never again...",4,5
"The only street wear boutique in Tempe!! Besides Urban Outfitter which is across the street! A shop like this can be found in your West LA shopping district! They have 10Deep  Crooks  Kid Robot  The Hundreds and many more! For now I'll give a 4 store since its new in the valley until they get more brands I like from the West LA area and the rating will go up! They are on the right track though! One of the owner is real nice! Got a real nice greeting when we got in! Place is designed just like a street wear boutique should look like! Small and what ever you need he will get it for you from the back! Heard one of the owner is Javon Walker who is also a good friend of Anquan Boldin! Probably why his shop is in AZ! Its close to my house so I'll be there often to get what I need!",2,3
"My middle daughter moved to Arizona a couple of years ago and really missed the San Diego-style Carne Asada Burritos she was used to.  Everytime she would come home she would hit Chili Banditos/Buenos Dias for her fix.  Then she discovered Los Favoritos and called me excitedly to let me know she had finally found a Taco Shop that had carne asada burritos the way she liked them.  When I came to Chandler she made sure to bring my family here to try it out and we liked it too.  She's been eating here every since.  Smart daughter.",3,2
"The one at 59 southwest This place suck. Everything expensive. Most items not on the system correctly  during check out they have to look all over the place. Also No display lcd price at the check out  so they only tell you how much it cost and you have to check your receipt again. Return are limited days and bad thing of all low experiences. Bad place to go for electronics.",2,2
"The flaky  buttery  and crispy on the outside but slightly chewy in the center croissants are simply divine! I promise you that after trying one of these piping hot freshly baked bundles of joy you will come back for more.   Two more Breton (Brittany) specialities to try is the Kouing Amann  a round crusty  rich but light cake made with puffed bread dough containing layers of butter and caramelized sugar or the famous Farz Breton  a traditional flan-style egg and mill custard dessert with raisins or other small fruits soaked in liquor or alcohol.  To round up your breakfast pit stop  don't miss out on a delicious cup of latt\u00e9 served by the charming hosts Elizabeth and Keith - who have seriously contagious smiles!  The sweet aroma and hustle & bustle of Nicolas Henri's artisan bakery remind me of such fond childhood memories when visiting my grandmother in France... hope this destination will help you find your happy place too!",3,1
"I love Del taco. the night guy working is the worst human I've ever seen at this location. he is the rudest person and I am a please and thank you could a person. he shouldn't work there...",2,2
"Falafel was outstanding. Whatever you order (I love the kababs)  order some on the side. The tahini will even come in handy with the chicken. Hummus is good - but not amazing. Needs to be a tad more creamy. That's my only teenie complaint. My only real issue: the table buzzer scares the crap out of me every time it goes off! Enjoy...",2,5
"We ordered takeout pizza and wings from Native New Yorker the other night.  I know it's a national chain but I've been to other locations with family a few times and it wasn't a bad experience.  They're chicken wings are actually quite good especially the oriental garlic.  So we ordered about 24 wings a buffalo beast pizza which is if I remember correctly  sausage  pepperoni  salami and meatballs  (pretty much lots of meat) what apparently the girl who took my order heard was buffalo chicken.  I picked up the food about 10 minutes away from my house  got home to find we had the wrong pizza.  I was initially upset so I called the restaurant and aftering being put on hold for a minute or two  I was in touch with a manager.  The manager after clarifying my order  offered to remake the pizza  I explained I really didn't feel like driving back and was quite hungry.  instead he took down my name and phone number and asked me to ask for a manager and to give my name and number the next time I call and they would credit me a free pizza.  Nontheless we we're hungry so we picked off the offending ingredients from the pizza we got and ate some of it  and the wings actually turned out pretty decent for take out.  A solid 3 for the manager acting accordingly in this situation.",1,1
"Ever Yelped so much you forgot if you Yelped about a place or not?  Well lucky me -- I forgot about this place  then again maybe for good reason.  For all the hype and cool designs -- the food really didn't match.  I ordered some curry and chicken - it was okay  but I was really hungry so maybe that's why it was okay.  The plating was nice  but maybe that's how they get you!  How about the price?  Extremely pricy for what you get -- I get more excited paying to gas up my car!  Okay the ambience is pretty cool - the Polynesian style decors are nice and fun.  Service? Well we had a large group and I can never understand this  but when you're a waiter; you should prepare for large and small groups.  I was a damn fine waiter in my times and I was always ready to rock!  I won't say they didn't do a good job  but --- they didn't do a good job -- :) I lied!  - Enjoy!",2,2
"The Three Cheese Chili is good and one of the most expensive sandwiches on the menu. $9.99. Other favorites like pastrami chili cheese fries and Hogies are good.

"We are locals in Las Vegas  we get tickets to concerts at the Orleans  so tgi's is the logical place to eat. Not the best  service there is not very good  it is hit and miss  sometimes we get great service sometimes horrible service! We went there on Nov. 10th for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd concert  the hostess sat us and took our drink orders and only brought water  not the beer my hubby order. We had to order from a waitress  did that got our drinks and appitizer  but hubby ordered the garlic shrimp that was supposed to be served on risotta style rice  uh what is that?? We thought risotta  not so..just burnt rice  in fact it was all burnt. We had no time to re order as we had a concert to get to. Just be sure when you go  order a burger or basic food  get there with plenty of time in case you bad service. Don't expect too much!",5,4
"Probably the best pizza in Las Vegas.   20 minute drive there from my house in Henderson  and it's still an easy choice.  Great great pizza.",4,4
"Overall great place to start our stay at the Cosmopolitan on a Friday afternoon!  After check-in we elected to get a cocktail prior to heading up to the room.  Our bartender was fantastic and even though the bar was getting crowded we were promptly served.  We had the hot mule and a a gin and tonic.  The ginger in the hot mule was delicious and so good we ordered another by a different bar tender and it was equally delicious!  Great place to start the weekend!",5,5
"Found this hidden place by accident.  You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. we started with shrimp and pork spring rolls. They were good and a large portion.  When it comes to Pho the choices are limited to basic chicken or beef. It is definitely aimed towards main stream eaters...nothing exotic here. The chicken Pho was good. The broth was fabulous.  I would try the bun next time... I liked it here and if I was close by I would return. I don't think I will go out of my way to become a regular.",2,2
"I am a pizza nut. Self admitted  I need help  nut. I couldn't believe how hard it is to find pizza in Vegas that suits my taste.   THIS IS IT! Phenomenal  fresh ingredients. Elegant  intricate yet classic flavors. Friendly  impeccable service.   Garlic knots: Sweet  large   buttery  garlic not overpowering. Served with great marinara  not some tomato sauce affair.  Greek Salad: perfect vinaigrette  feta that was like it was flown in today  crisp  impeccable.  Italian Sub: usually not my cup of tea. I guess I never had a good one before! The wife ordered it  and I almost stole it from her! Unbelievably well dressed and loaded.  The Pizza: Oh  the pizza. HOMEMADE meatball slices. Dough that was the soul of perfection. Not salted to heck and gone  to make you drink more soda. Perfect compliment of flavors.   Zeppole: Never had it before. OMG. The same delicate pizza dough fried  the blanketed in powdered sugar  served with berry dip  then a custard dip. (Did in order as instructed.) Like the best powdered doughnut you've ever had in your life  only fresh and warm. If you hadn't of told me they were fried  I would not have ever guessed that.   Overall  I can totally see why so highly reviewed. We will be back  again and again!  A total value!!! You'll find cheaper. But you'll not find better.",5,1
"Have to say I am super bummed. Guess I got spoiled at the queen Creek location so maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been. That said let me tell you the positives: place was relatively clean although we did need our table cleaned before we could sit down. The staff was welcoming  pleasant and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly - interesting that they delivered each dish when it was ready vs the whole order at once.  So with all the good so far what went wrong right?  Well it was the food. I ordered a create your own - as I always do - and while the burger was hot in temperature that was all the good I can share. The lettuce was limp and barely covered the bun  there was almost no sauce   the pickles and jalape\u00f1os were very small - not like at the qc spot when you get big thick junks of crisp vegetables - and the burger could not have been greasier. Now I have a major problem with wet bread and not only did I go threw a bunch of napkins trying to dry off the bun and patty but there was actually a puddle in my plate before I could even finish. Had I ordered take out I wouldn't have had anything good to share about the experience. Oh and lastly the constant bugging if things can be taken away made me feel like I needed to hurry up and get out. Super bummed.",2,1
"Super nice and they gave me a great deal for a one time service. I would definitely use them again.",3,1
"I like the brand discount tire but this one in tega cay has a bunch of kids running it.  Brought my car here to get the tires rotated and no one was here (customers) They were just standing around instead of working on my car.  I own a car dealership up in Mooresville nc and spend a ton of money on tires up at that discount tire.  This one needs help   training and showing here crew people what a sense of urgency is.  The more cars you get in and out the more money you make.   By the way 9 employees here and I have been here for an hour.  Not coming back to this location.",2,1
"I was here the last time I was in Vegas and the service was much better.  This time we were here the service at the bar was really fun and prompt  we had a few mason jars of beer and an appetizer while we waited for our table.  I wish we would have just stayed at the bar!  Once we were seated it took 15 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us  then 40 minutes for our food to come out and my husband's pulled pork sandwich and fries were so cold I actually sent back food for the first time in my entire life.  Once it came back out it was good  and my salad with chicken was perfect.  The greens and veggies were very very cold  and the chicken was perfect.  Also  it was so large that I couldn't finish it...when is the last time that a garden salad was so big you couldn't finish it?  I really appreciated having a good size serving of a healthy option in the sea of gluttony that Vegas can be.  Overall  the atmosphere is really fun if you like country music but I would just grab a seat at the bar and eat there while you are entertained by wonderful bartenders!!",1,1
"Great variety and amount of tickets. They list the tickets they have available around 9:30 am on their boards outside their locations and start selling them around 10. They have about 6 or 7 locations along the strip and downtown. The two busiest ones (at least from my experience) have been Fashion Show mall and the one by the Riviera.  After you get the vouchers for the show you want  you will have to go the that show's box office to get the real tickets and seat assignments. Yes  it's a hassle  but you're saving money so it's worth it. I'd recommend going to the box office as soon as possible to get the best seats.   You can buy an annual VIP pass for Tix 4 Tonight. This allows you to bypass the long ticket line and they won't charge you a service fee.  If you have a gift certificate to Tix 4 Tonight you can also get in the VIP line instead of waiting in the regular line.",5,4
"The food for restaurant week was excellent. The cocktails were excellent (anytime u can get a vesper martini done correctly I am a happy camper) and the service was the shining star  from our server to the gm to the owner it was WIN/WIN all around.   Worth a trip",2,4
"First time at cherry blossom cafe  the food is very good 4 stars  however my server in particular very very rude and not helpful with menu questions  took him 20 minutes to bring the bread and appetizer  we ask for a side of rice in the middle of our food  we had to ask other servers for it  he just forgot  very bad attitude  I say to those guys if you don't like your job  do something else  don't serve people",4,1
"These are the best donuts I have had ever since I moved away from the east coast and Texas. Ever since I have moved to Vegas  I have been looking for a donuts place that sells actual donuts; none of those Krispy Kreme's so called donuts. Well  Ronald's has them!!!  They have many varieties  but I usually just get the plain  chocolate or sugar sprinkles.   Bottom line is  if you know better to get Krispy Kreme  you need to try Ronald's and brace yourself for some real donuts!!! Bon App\u00e9tit!",1,1

"The customer service is top notch especially for a fast food joint.  I ordered the 3 piece chicken finger meal and it was good. The chicken is fried but greasy at all  on the inside the chicken is very moist and and tender not dry and overcooled like most chicken finger/ tenders.   The only downside the breading could use a little bit flavoring.  Overall the food was high quality and not to expensive  I would go back.",4,3

"I had the tofu spring rolls and tofu dumplings for apps. Lemongrass shrimp over broken rice for an entree. Pretty good - healthy food. Still felt hungry however. Would like to try again. I feel like I could do a better job of ordering next time - perhaps a soup bowl with noodles would be in order. I don't think that they serve beer which is unfortunate.",3,2
"Tony Bourdain we followed you here and found that your dream fries were less tasty  than McDonalds and a not less tasteless steak attested that your review was a big favor you had to do to Thomas Keller.

"I went again last week for an appointment and I really don't think I'll be returning. Again I love Carrie she is wonderful but the front desk is annoying. Once again I was asked several times if I want a package again I said no  because with the services I get I don't save any money in fact if I miss even one appointment time I actually lose money because I pre-pay the packages. I asked her to not ask again and she said they all have to ask or they will get in trouble. It's ridiculous. I won't be returning  because I have no interest in setting myself up to be annoyed every four weeks!",4,4

"The home of Darby O'Gill and the Little People.  The best local band in Vegas.  Only 4 stars because you have to walk through the douchebags playing beer pong before you get to the stage where Darby plays.",3,4
"This was a nice place to stay. It's in an area that can be quite noisy sometimes  right near a hospital so you are likely to hear sirens now and then  but not to awful bad. All the rooms here are suites  so it's like a little apartment of your own. You get a kitchen with an almost full size fridge  2 burner stovetop  microwave  and coffee maker. A little living room area with a couch  chair  and desk. Our room was a king suite  and the bed was very comfy. I liked the bathroom setup  the shower and toilet were in their own little room and the sink was outside  so if I was doing my hair and makeup  my fella could still take his shower and we were not in each others' way. Full closet  ironing board and iron  but one demerit for not having a hair dryer. Free breakfast was pretty darn good   eggs  waffles  oatmeal  cereal  yogurt  bread  bagels  muffins  juice  coffee  and more. Better than most free breakfasts. I will most definitely consider Residence Inns on any future trips if there is one in the area  I was quite comfortable here.",4,3
"My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch. The service was shockingly friendly. Phrank was cheerful and pleasant. The prices are awesome. We filled our bellies under twenty bucks! The only down side is the food is simple and plain. I had the chicken tacos combo and my boyfriend had a wet red sauce burrito. Neither had much taste at all  which was disappointing because it looked so yummy and the service/environment was five stars easily. Please Phrank you have an awesome set up! Don't let the bland bandit get you.",3,2

"So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try.   The atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon.   Service was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory.   All in all  the trip was worth it  but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said  I doubt I will be returning on my own accord.",1,1
"We tried Bacchanal for lunch on a Wednesday. In our party we had 3 Adults  1- 8 yo  1-3yo (she was free!!). We waited in line for about 10-15min. We were seated at a nice large round table.   On arrival- the food lines/presentations seemed never ending! Almost overwhelming! Everything we tried- we loved. Highly recommend... Everything!! The prime rib was succulent  melted in your mouth. The brisket was moot and tasty. All the seafood was sooooo fresh. They had fresh squeezed fruit juices.   We loved all the desserts. From ice cream  cakes  brownies  cookies  cupcakes and made to order crepes & souffl\u00e9s.  There truly wasn't anything we didn't like. Everything was so fresh and tasty!!  Can't wait to go back!!",3,5
"Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people  which is pretty good. As for the pizza  the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin  and the sauce was sweet  not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself  so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy  but tasty. Overall  if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it.",1,1

"Meh.  That about explains it the most.  It's Cirque  it is going to be amazing acrobats doing amazing things.  What sets a decent  good and great Cirque show apart is how well it is tied together and the running characters. This one was a bit more or just a series of acts that were very poorly tied together and some pretty bad transitions between the two.  It is supposed to be whimsical and seen though the eyes of the child  but I just really didn't get that theme across as much as they should.  When one set of acrobats would end  there might be some little transition where you can see people on stage moving things around preparing for the next group.  Everything done was impressive and amazing  there just wasn't much tying it together.  At times I was actually finding myself a bit bored during some of the bits of the show.  Or looking off into other directions where you see them getting ready for the next act.   If you like the acrobatics and nothing else  you will NOT be disappointed.  But if you have seen Cirque and seen a show with multiple facets and things going on with an actual story tying it together  then you can do better with other shows.  While talking about it  there is also the place the show is in.  The theater at TI  which is a pretty old venue.  This is a classic theater with nothing but theater seating. Zumaity had couches and seats for couples  others have had the tables and waitress service.  This is just a run of the mill theater with tons of seating.  Not too comfortable  not at all romantic.  (Can't even raise the arm rests to cuddle).  The formality of it all just makes the act and acrobats seem more distance and almost movie like. TI really should put some effort into updating the theater.",5,5
"My dog  Zoey and I frequent this dog park and we love it. There are 3 different fenced-in areas: one for large dogs  one for small dogs and one that is closed off so the grass has a chance to grow back. The park maintenance team does a good job at rotating the areas so there is grass for the pups at all times. Each area has a water fountain (at human level and dog level)  covered seating and multiple entrances. I go there almost daily and I have found that on average the dogs (and their owners) are very nice and well mannered but I highly suggest staying aware of the dogs coming in the park. Sometimes (as at any dog park) idiots bring their aggressive dogs who have been cooped up all day and they almost always cause a problem BUT if you pay attention you can almost always avoid the problem because of the multiple exits. Overall  this park is great. They have recently put in lights so people can stay after dark. Those lights should be turning on within the next couple weeks. Hooray!",3,3
"A legit Hawaiian style eatery owned by local people from Hawaii. Items tried: Garlic Chicken and Firecracker Chicken. Both were delicious!!! Their portions are generous and well worth the price. Just a tip  you get more for your money if you order a regular plate Insted of a mini. It has a very homey feel  I felt like I was at my aunties house back in Hawaii :) Staff was welcoming & friendly. Food was fresh and served up quickly. Definitely check them out if you are in the area.",1,1
".... Meh  not worth it. Layout sucks really unorganized in terms of general flow of people about the club. Overpriced.",4,3
"This restaurant made a special deal with travel zoo for $99 stating that is was worth $415.  The food on their special menu was absolutely deplorable and I feel like I was scammed by this deal.  We ended up paying $190.02 after all was said and done   with no additional food/ beverages.    After looking at their regular menu  there is no way possible I got $190.02 worth of food and services.  We would have been better off paying full price and getting regular items off of their menu.  I will never eat at another n9ne restaurant.   We were given a table with no view although there were many open tables by the windows  the salad was so bitter we did not even eat it  the calamari was ok  the pizza was good  the rigatoni was extremely bland/bad  the risotto was ok  the chicken Marsala was the worst I have ever had  the fish was ok  the dessert was disappointing.   To top it our sub-par meal we got the bill that included gratuity on the total $415 value that included passes to the nightclubs.  Since when do you pay gratuity for passes?   Based on our experience and just judging the food  there are a plethora of better restaurants in Henderson/Vegas that have much better food at much better prices.  This place is not worth your time.",3,3

"I booked a cut/color/highlight after purchasing a Groupon. Usually  I look up reviews of the place of business before purchasing  but did not do so this time  as the salon was close by and I needed something done quickly.  My first pleasant surprise was the ability to book my appointment online. EVERY business should do this! The salon's online appointment system is simple to use  and pretty fool proof. I loved that I didn't have to stop what I was doing to make a call  wait for an answer  then go through my calendar with someone over the phone. This was quick - look at what they have available  pick my time  BOOM  done! Love it.  When I arrived for my appointment  I was a little surprised to find that it was in the Signature Salon building  which I have passed literally hundreds of times over the past several years  but never knew what it was about. Kim's salon room was easy to find  tidy  and very comfortable.  As we began our consultation  I was thrilled to hear that SHE was happy with what I wanted. I love going red with color  and so many colorists balk at that  thinking I don't know what I really want. Kim not only loved the idea  but also was able to flip right to the correct shade after she took a look at my skin tone and gauged my natural color against what I was asking for.  As for the process itself  she did it perfectly. She was very thorough  which is unusual in and of itself. I've been getting my hair done in various salons for many many years  and I don't think anyone has ever been so thorough. I liked that she combed the base color all over  because people usually miss the hair by my temples  which is the only place I have gray hair.  As for the woman herself  she was very sweet and kind  not overbearing  not pushy. She wasn't too chatty  as many stylists can be  but definitely showed an interest and kept the conversation flowing.  I liked her business model  and she definitely has some great ideas to keep up with current trends  both in hair styling AND as a businesswoman.  Frankly  I can't say enough good things. My hair looks fabulous  I feel awesome  and I'm thrilled to have found a local  independent business that I can continue to support.   Go see her  you won't be disappointed!",2,5
"Wonderful food  wine  service and view. Not to be missed.",5,5
"I usually find myself here when I'm staying with the parents in their timeshare.   I find the Wyndham Grand Desert much nicer than expected  even when it was a Fairfield.  And that makes sense  now that I know (from Susan's review) that it was designed by  the person who designed Bellagio.   We usually stay here in the colder months so I haven't ventured into the pool. The interior of our 3 bedroom suite is especially luxe with a contemporary feel.  LOVE that it doesn't have a casino.  I'm not much of a gambler anyway  but it's makes for a nice and quiet hotel experience.  Shuttles to the Strip make going to a casino relatively easy  and Planet Hollywood and Hard Rock  are only short walks away.  The location on Koval and Harmon provide for stunning views of the Strip if you get a north facing room.  The activities room  happy hour snacks and Internet/computer center were also bonus.",3,5
"I decided to go to Harvest because I love the farm to table concept.  We had a raw fish appetizer.  I don't mind small dishes  but when the food runner kept looking back after she dropped it off I knew she was waiting for our reaction.  Three tiny slivers of fish topped with two slices of jalape\u00f1o.  $14.  My boyfriend had a curry clam dish.  He was very pleased with the amount of clams.  I had the beef New York strip special.  It was well done on some parts and raw On another.  The main reason I give this poor review is because the meat was not beef.  It had silver skin and was some sort of wild game.  Unfortunately  I don't see a reason to return.  For the price I'll go to Tornado Room and leave full and satisfied.",5,5
"I've now eaten at a few Sauce locations and every experiance has been very positive. I really enjoyed the airport location because I travel a lot and have found often times you don't find good food at airports. The food came out quick which is great when you have a flight to catch. They boxed it up for me nicely which made it easy for my to take leftovers onto the plane if I wanted.   I've tried a few of the pastas and they are all great  my fav is the Chicken & broccoli pasta  delicious. Sauce has also help me find a new favorite wine  Snoqualmie  which is difficult because I am so picky when it comes to my wine. Has to be sweet and fruity. Cheers to you Sauce !!",2,5

"My brother swears by the AE jeans - its what he wears.  They don't work for me.  I will admit I have some nice button down shirts given to me as gifts over the years - that's what I went into look for today.  I went through several shirts and sizes up front  wondered the store a bit  looked at some jeans and other shirts as well.   There were 2 associates on the floor.  Neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while I was there.  On a visit after this initial review - same exact scenario but I was the only one there on a weekend evening - I was acknowledged by an associate whom I stood in front of and she informed me of their sale going on.  I have shopped there a couple times previously and don't recall a negative experience with service - they just must not be trained to be proactive.",2,4
"We walked in for pedicures to have absolutely no waiting room to stand or sit in. Very crowded feeling  not a welcome feeling. Immediately instructed to grab a polish and were seated within 5 min or so with no appointments.  Used new bath sanitary plastic shield for foot tub for each treatment.  Both my friend and I picked a simple deluxe scrub and cooling rub (from what I remember) and were instructed that it should really go with the foot scrub add on. Well  if it is best used together...then package it that way! Don't roll your eyes and act like we're idiots for not choosing it correctly.  Overall the treatment and pedicure were good. They just need to reword pedicure options and have a bigger reception area at entrance. And as always  gave attitude for choosing to pay and tip by credit card  instead of cash.",3,5
"I will never go back to standard airport parking.  Blue Sky Airport was a fantastic option (unless you're literally running to make your flight ..... it is a little tucked away off-site) and SO MUCH cheaper than on-site parking  especially when it seems you can always get $2 off covered or uncovered.  First off  there is an employee waiting at the machine where you get your ticket who radios someone else in the van.  By the time I put my car in park  there was a van waiting to take me to the airport and straight to my terminal.  No waiting for anyone else which can definitely add to your total wait time.  On the ride back to my car  there was a van pulling up as we left the baggage claim and  once again  no waiting for others (ie - to get a full van) before heading back to the parking lot.  Quick and easy payment and make sure you get your frequent parker card - 7 days parking gets you 1 day free!",4,3

"A nightclub experience is what you make of it and me and my girls made it a fun  classy night to remember.  The layout of this place is awesome. When the elevators door open and you walk into the main room its POPPIN'.  We ventured into the different rooms and had a blast in the hip-hop room awhile. That room was small but the music was so fun and oldschool and brought me back many memories!   As the night progressed we met up with our friends at a table upstairs looking at the DJ. We could see the entire club dance floor and had a perfect view of Calvin Harris. Sitting at a table is nice in here because it gets super packed and I was able to rest my feet and enjoy the cocktails/show. There was confetti and smoke blast galore! I tried to dance on the main floor once but it was too much for me...but I expected that on labor day weekend. Another big plus for me was the ventilation of this place  I never felt too hot!   If you're in area I think it's worth trying..",1,1
"What a goofy fun time!  It was so good to be indoors away from the 100 F temps!  But besides the air controlled building  this place is very entertaining and totally encourages silly behavior... which I LOVE!  Room after room  there were were plenty of waxed celebs. And surprisingly  they were incredibly realistic! I love that you can use props and do fun poses with the statues.  It's great for all ages and it's gives you the opportunity to take great photographs that you'll definitely laugh at when you're all done!  =D",3,4
"We actually ate here twice  lunch on Sunday and Breakfast on Monday.  Food was ok.  What loses a star is the cost.  It is overpriced for what you get -- I  guess I was thinking that being Vegas it would be more reasonable.  Granted  I was thinking Denny's prices.  The salad was good  but very basic - a lot of lettuce  chicken  lettuce ... you get the picture..  The breakfast was good.   Our server had brought out the preservatives that I wanted (Raspberry) instead of telling me that it wasn't available - so yeah for that!",1,1
"Fffffrrrreeeezing in winter  I'll accept  but I still like Ratho. A lot. Giant walls for climbing  shopping  bouldering  gym and massage  all in one space. I like it.   Even more so since we signed up for the combined climbing and fitness card - so we can climb as much as we want  and also used the jaw droppingly impressive gym (Judo team use the same gym  so it is pretty impressive).   Even better  as part of Edinburgh Leisure  we can also use other gyms/pools (including the Commonwealth... at an additional cost)/golf courses in the area for free. Given the 'lets go to the gym' feeling hits at random  it also means we can use the gyms closest to work  or home  without having to always pack in the distance.   I'll be toning up in no time! Well  ok... at least it's the thought that counts...",3,3
"Excellent service & tasty coffee :)",1,2
"Quite tasty sandwiches  although I don't really understand the appeal of fries inside the sammies. I always take them out and eat them separately. Call me traditional.  Greasy  as could be expected  but delicious after drinking or if you're craving a hefty meal for any other reason besides a futile attempt to divert alcohol from destroying your liver.  And speaking of alcohol  they have the cheapest beer in town! Not quite sure how they sell Yuengling for $2. Might be stolen goods. I'm ok with that.  Certainly not gourmet  interesting food that I couldn't make myself  so I just can't bring myself to give them above a 3  but for what it is  it's pretty good.",4,4
"In order to save some money but still keep it classy  homegirl Jaymie S. decided to put us up in the Wyndham  and I'm glad she did so. For my entire Vegas trip of 3 days and 2 nights  I only paid about $20 for the hotel. Sure  there were 20 of us in a 3 bed suite (+1 pullout futon)  but I was able to save a good amount of money and still sleep comfortably.   The Wyndham is great for those who don't want the hustle and bustle  as well as the prices of the Strip  but still want to be within a 5 min walk.  The suites come with all the necessary amenities  including very nicely decorated bathrooms  a kitchen  TV  radio  etc.   Even on a hot 110 F day  the pool was kept to a perfect temperature and not overheated like most pools tend to be. Great lounge chairs and towels  and a nice jacuzzi with a back massage fountain.  As Nina Y. heavily emphasizes  it was nice.",4,2
"I ate here today for lunch and it was good. It is not a 4 Star restaurant by no means. They serve food on foam plates and give you plastic utensils.   The best thing about this place is the fact that they have good food at a very good price. I dont think you will find a better deal in The Market.",1,1
"Our good friend's brother recently took over as Chef de Cuisine at Table Ten  so while we were in Vegas for a quick weekend of hiking (yep  you heard me right - we're not so much into the casino thing) we thought it might be fun to stop by this restaurant to introduce ourselves to him.  He (Sean) was previously Chef de Cuisine at Delmonico  another Vegas standout. So  I fully understand that my review may be a bit biased  since we received excellent service and a few creations directly from Sean - he's trying some new things out on the menu  which is a clear indicator to me that Table Ten is supportive of good-intentioned progress. A great sign for any restaurant  indeed. Sean spoke with us and explained his commitment to local  organic food sources - and how he's incorporating some of these items into the new menu.  We started out with an incredible array of appetizers - the knockout being a gumbo-style dish. The flavors were completely punch-you-in-the-face delicious and the shrimp was prepared perfectly.   We also tried the pork dumplings (my husband's fave  he's never met a potsticker he didn't like)  which were wonderful.  Organic Kentor Farm Spinach Salad - AMAZING. Perfect combination of flavors  Sean! I could've had this as a meal.  I know we had a couple other things  too - all of which were delectable. But of course  Sean treated us to my favorite dessert of all time (how did he know?!) - Bananas Foster.  AY CHEE WAH-WAH!  It was truly one of the best desserts I've ever had. The combination of warm bananas  ice-cold vanilla ice cream  and caramelized sauce is out-of-control luscious. It was elegant in its simplicity. YUM.   I'd highly recommend this place - Sean is doing some great things here  and it will be great to see the changes he implements take hold. I'm sure there's a bit of an adjustment period taking place at Table Ten  but if our meal was any indication  everything is headed in a great direction.  One of our best dining experiences in Vegas.",5,4

"Good Stuff 1. Greatest selection EVER.  2. Very knowledgeable  helpful and ....ahem cute staff. 3. Check imdb/rottentom movie ratings/reviews before you rent. They have a computer hooked up to the internet in the store!!  4. Rental Block. If you are planning on staying on campus for a couple of months you just have to buy their $100 rental block which gets you 100 movies for 3 days each. 5. On Campus  open till 11:59pm 6. Top Movie rental lists for each genre are put up all around the store. 7. Stuff on their website!! eg. http://www.rentertainment.com/local.asp  Minor issues: 1. Most of the time they will only have one copy of a old movie. And if someone misplaces that particular copy then it will take a couple of weeks/months for the replacement to come in (eg. The Game of Michael Douglas fame was missing for a few weeks). 2. 6pm/9pm return time !! 3. This place really spoils you. You will never be able to use netflicks or blockbuster again.  I really miss this place now that I've moved to CA... :'-( movie rental would never be the same.

"Meathead's is a dependable burger spot that comfortably sits in between the upper end fast food of Wendy's and the local sit down offerings of Farren's  etc. While the patty itself is not quite as good as Five Guy's  the topping options put Meathead's ahead  in my opinion. I love the Texas Ranch burger (bacon  cheddar  BBQ)  and the option to add a fried egg with the Cajun Sunrise is top notch! Also  the awesome soda machine and delicious chipotle flavored ketchup are fantastic additions! My only complaints are that sometimes my burger is a touch too greasy  and the cost is maybe $1 or so more than I would think appropriate. But never enough to prevent me from looking forward to my next visit!",4,5

"Seems more like the place to be seen than a place that's known for quality sushi  but I guess that's par for the course for any business in the Hilldale area.  I've dined here more than a dozen times  and the experience seems to border between 2 and 3 stars; more often two than three.  I'm unlikely to add any new info or insight - with 60+ reviews at this point  folks have covered the ins-and-outs of this place.  Drinks take forever to arrive - whether it's an iced tea  a beer  or a cocktail - expect to wait around 10-minutes for your beverage.  Servers are hit-or-miss  with most leaning toward the entitled side.  They're largely absent; they'll take your drink order  then disappear for 10+ minutes.  Your drink will arrive and they'll take your sushi order  then disappear until the food is ready.  The next time you'll see them is when your plate is clean and they ask if you'd like the check or dessert.  I've honestly never had a follow-up or a check-in from a server during any of my meals here.  The sushi itself is conservative and safe.  It's not exciting  and it's not knock your socks off amazing.  It's about what you'd expect from an upper midwest sushi spot.  Having enjoyed sushi from both coasts  I guess I'm a little spoiled (and jaded).    Prices are a touch on the high side  but it's not unreasonable.    You can do worse than Muramoto.",5,5

Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award)  live music with great jazz bands  excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced.

"Huge selection in a massive showroom space...  The building is a bit old  but it gets the job done (watch the narrow stairs - only folks in one direction at the time).  Prices generally low with the same brands and similar quality options to Ashley and AFW.  Sales guy was pleasantly attentive without being aggressive or in-your-face.  They operate in a pretty old school fashion.   Paper sales slip.  Limited use of automation.  What appears to be human scheduling of delivery (they schedule you for a day and you can call in the morning to figure out if you're morning/afternoon and what stop you are).  We ended purchasing a sectional and power reclining (both working out great so far).  Prices were very good (same as AFW) and deliver was more than reasonable.  We were able to get delivery next-day as our stuff was in-stock.  We called in the morning as instructed and got an afternoon ETA.  They showed up pretty close to the estimated time.  The crew was very fast/hardworking/professional.  All-in-all it was a very good experience.",5,3
"Ok  so I show up on a Sunday night (a.k.a. Valentine's Day in most of the Western world) to grab a drink with some friends  walked in the door and was greeted by three small children running for the door. If I were drinking something at the time  would have definitely done a spit take. My thought process: Kids? Bar? Then  why wasn't I allowed to go to a bar as a 6-year old? I felt momentarily robbed.  There was definitely some kind of party going on  lots of balloons everywhere  country/western music blasting from the DJ booth. Lots of locals without a lot of teeth who got down with their bad selves on the dance floor  with a side of some Paco Paco holdovers wearing exotically printed tight dresses standing their ground. Drinks (premium) were $5.50  and were incredibly tiny. We stayed long enough to finish my miniature drink and headed out. Might give it another try when it isn't kid's birthday/Paco Paco Valentine's day/dancing toothless locals/Country/Western night. Maybe.",2,2
"I enjoyed a nice Father's Day dinner here last weekend. It took a few min to get a table inside since we hasn't made a reservation. The hostess was able to luckily squeeze us inside as opposed to the patio.  There was a great promotion going on for a free pizza that day. We started with beer and appetizers. None of the happy hour food items sounded that great but all draft beer was only $2.50! Can't beat that especially with a good selection of local beer like sleepy dog and four peaks. For apps  we tried the fried ravioli and spicy buffalo wings. Both were excellent  I would def recommend the ravioli! The app margerita pizza we ordered was pretty small but tasty.  The full size pizzas come in a huge variety of toppings.. We tried the goat cheese and artichoke pizzas. I recommend the goat cheese pizza as it had fresh cuts of grape tomatoes. The crust was perfectly chewy and wood fired  my favorite kind if pizza. All in all  a great meal  made better by good happy hour and free pizza for Father's Day! Not sure if I'd come back during normal hours since the pizzas are on the pricier end.",3,1
"My family has been coming to Lombardinos frequently for many years  and we believe it's the best restaurant in Madison. From the top-notch service  cozy ambiance  and incredible rustic Italian food created by chef Patrick  Lombardino's is not to be missed. I was so thrilled when they agreed to cater my wedding this past summer  and wow  did they deliver. They were so accomodating and worked with us to create a rustic menu with local and seasonal ingredients. Our friends and family still rave about it and the food was totally outstanding. Thank you Lombardinos!",4,4
"They re-opened this location about 3mos ago.  They have now enclosed the bar area with plexiglass (for a smoking section  I assume).  I had the lasagna and their house red wine.  The food was average  the wine great for $3 and being out of a box.  Service was good.  Overall it's a decent sports bar establishment with higher price-points on their food but decent happy hour drink pricing.  The wine list is fairly extensive for this type of establishment.  Brew selection was below-average for a sports bar.",4,5

"Pros:  Great Patio dinning for this time of year Great Service Dessert was good had the trio platter Half Price wine night on Tuesdays and good wine selection at decent prices  Middle Ground:  Mezze Dip platter aah  it was OK. Nothing to write home about. Have had better dips before. The tzatziki was nice though. Eggplant dip was not what I was used to having visited Greece and Turkey  Not so Good:  The flounder. It was SUPER dry. Like fried beyond all recognition. The sauces were nice that came with it but there wasn't enough. Both me and my friend had the same platter and both used our mezz dips to drown the fish in. Neither one of us finished the fish. Could have used more artichokes in the potato  salad artichoke thing which was mostly just potatoes and nothing spectacular about that either.   Other issue I had was that our entrees came out to soon we had barely recieved our dips when the entree came out.  Overall would recommend the place just not the flounder.",3,1
"Fun!  That's how I'd describe our experience at Los Reyes De La Torta.    Picture it - a lazy scorching hot Sunday in Arizona.

Forget the fact that  yes  we DID find out about this restaurant via Man vs. Food.  It just seemed too tempting NOT to try it since Adam actually visited a restaurant in the 602!  We knew what we were getting into - a huge torta big enough to feed two!  We were ready!  Upon arrival - it looked packed!  Although located in what people might describe as a sketchy area of town  we never felt that vibe.  Just an eclectic mix of people  families  couples  kids  milling around outside.  We thought for sure we were in for a long wait!  Wrong!  First off - the restaurant is actually bigger than it appears.  There were three different sections for diners to eat.  We were seated immediately at a table near the entrance which suited us just fine. We already knew what we wanted.  One Torta del Rey please!    We decided to share it - I knew I just wanted a taste (my body is not accustomed to that much meat at one time).  The waitress took our order in a matter of seconds.  Such prompt  and friendly service!  We knew it must be an authentic hangout because a bulk of the wait staff spoke broken English.  always a good sign - like when I go to an authentic Chinese Restaurant.  I expect the staff to be incomprehensible.  I also look for other Asians in the restaurant as validity.  Los Reyes de la Torta definitely seemed like a locals spot - very authentic - which made us like it even more.  So - within about 5 minutes - our order was up!  And OMG was it great!  Huge torta - layered with meats.  I won't list them because most of our fellow yelpers already have - I just want to say that the flavor was amazing!  Such a good deal and so much meat for only $7.99.  Served with potato chips and two different kinds of salsas (green and red) red being my favorite because it was spiciest.  Very very good salsa.  The awesome thing about sitting in the main area by the entrance was that we had full view of the kitchen.  My fiance and I stared in awe  watching how fast the chefs were able to churn tout the food.  Everything was made fresh - we wondered how many of the Torta Del Reys they actually cook each day! Most people ordered that.  The reason for the four stars is because although the sandwich is HUGE as is - there is an option for extra meat for a cost.  Of course - this is what had been served to Adam in the Man vs Food episode.  There is  a definite difference as to what was aired on TV.  We decided not to order extra meat this time around - and to save that for a time when we could go with a group of people.  Again the torta is meaty enough as is  the extra meat version be fun to do as a challenge with friends.  Overall a super fun time and a great experience.  Fast  friendly service and good fresh food.  Oh - and clean! Super super clean!  That was a surprise.  I've been to enough sketchy Chinatown restaurants and have become somewhat immune to that dirty feeling - but this restaurant was definitely well kept!  They also serve a huge selection of frozen drinks (both alcoholic or virgin) that I want to try next time!  Definitely give Los Reyes a try - or if you want a fun experience - take a group!  The food alone is entertaining enough!",3,5
"Pretty awesome place  great/helpful staff  and it smells really good in here lol. They have a lot of flavors and different mods to choose from. Got some help from Dylan and Diego today. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Stop by if you're in the area!",2,2
"I get why people dig Cold Stone- it's like Subway  but with ice cream and other goodies. I for one just like me some plain  good creamy vanilla ice cream without all the bells and whistles. What can I say? I'm a cheap date and easy to please for the most part so Cold Stone is not on my regular rotation.  That being said  I work with some ladies who while lovely have much more discerning taste and that is where Cold Stone comes to my rescue. Their Ice Cream cakes really are good so whenever there is a birthday or special occasion at work  I pop into Cold Stone and pick up a Coffee House Crunch (Coffee Ice Cream  devil's food cake covered in chocolate and topped with Heath bars). It keeps my ladies satisfied every time.",5,5
"I had a gift certificate that I thought could be used to purchase a bottle of wine  but was told by the owner that it only applied to beer or wine poured by the glass.  There are tables set up on the side for this purpose.  A menu is posted of what is available on any given evening.  The owner said there are free tastings on Thursday evenings  but our schedule would not allow us to attend.  We returned on a Saturday night when we sampled 5-ounce glasses of Pietra Santa merlot.   The wine was good as was the company of the bartender and a few other patrons.",5,1
"My husband and I made last minute reservations here for dinner after a show on Saturday night and we are so glad we did. The restaurant was busy when we arrived at 9pm  but we were sat right away. This restaurant offers beautiful views of the Bellagio fountain  so it was nice to watch the show go off every 15 mins or so.  Our waitress was accommodating and friendly  and took the time to go through things on the menu we weren't quite sure about. We ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse flatbread  it had shaved ham  mozzarella  asparagus and caramelized onion. It was very good  the bread had a nice consistency  doughy but crisp. My husband ordered the special  spaghetti and meatballs in a cream sauce. He said it was good  but the cream sauce lacked in flavor. I ordered the beef tenderloin  it came as a perfect medium. It had a nice crust to it  and was like butter when cut. The mashed potatoes were nice  as well as the tempura asparagus. We also chose to get the zucchini sticks  and so glad we did. They were seriously one of the tastiest things I ate our whole trip.   The service here was amazing  and super attentive. Drinks were topped off frequently  and I'm pretty sure it would be impossible to finish a water without someone refilling it. Food was served quickly as well  we spent less than an hour here  but never once felt rushed. We will definitely return here when we come back to Vegas !",3,3
"I live in a near by community and I have been going to this spa for many years.  The staff is absolutely the best from the desk personnel (Michelle and Ali) to the spa technicians (Courtney  Patsy and Bella).  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to be treated to a special experience.",5,5
"I love picking the car I want and going. Great concept!",3,5
"Being a designer  I was initially drawn to shibuya by its wonderfully executed interiors. Spot on design; eclectic  warm  and intimate with perfect lighting. One the surface  it is a beautifully layered environment.   Beyond the attractive interiors  the food and service was top notch. We were initially seated up front next to a couple of affliction/ Ed hardy clad malcontents; but following a request to be relocated  the hostess accommodated us with a more private table in the rear dining room. Our waiter was very gracious and  attentive. The quality of the fish was out of this world. The salmon and tuna melted the second it hit our mouths. The presentation was simple and straight forward. The most surprising aspect of the night was the price; very very reasonable. Their roll prices are on par with what you would pay at your neighborhood sushi bar. My wife and I escaped  with alcohol  with a bill that was under $100. Needless to say  this is one of the best fine dining values on the strip.   I highly recommend Shibuya. This will certainly be a regular stopping point for us on our Vegas excursions.

UuAb7_BzbhWDPaGiBK9sXg,tbTc7094zwIYAtU-0NkU4w,0.0571428571429,3,I rate hotels in Las Vegas different from most hotels because when I stay at a hotel in Las Vegas I gamble there  I eat there  I'll usually go to the nightclub or lounge there and possibly shop there.  I might go to other establishments for anything I mentioned above but it's nice if I don't have to.   I was excited when I saw a great rate on Tripres that also included perks..free entrance to the nightclub Rain.  I really wanted to stay at the Palms just from it's sheer reputation of luxury and decadence.      Well  the room was normal.  It was clean and nice but normal ... whaaah!   Hey  what's going on the TV doesn't work.  Nope  the TV works the remote doesn't.   I called housekeeping and waited. Called again and waited.   Apparently  somebody will be right up means 1.5 hours.   I went downstairs to play the slot machines.   I didn't think anyplace could be as bad as the MGM....wrong!   Money wasn't being exchanged and slowly lost  it was going one way and going fast.  It's funny how quickly 150 bucks can go.  I tried to prolong it by playing on the quarters.  It did prolong it  only because I had more credits to lose.   I figured I'll just play later on when the machines get hot.  Well  I kept trying and trying and trying but it was the same story everytime.  Darn...I'm staying here 3 nights.   That evening I met up with my friends and we went to Rain ... correction...we went to the entrance where the sign said closed for remodeling.   That's okay.  I've been there twice before and didn't really care for it but I had free passes from the Tripres promotion and the girls wanted to go dancing.  We went to the checkout the Playboy Club/Moon but the line was sucha  long wait that  the girls suggested we checkout the Ghost Bar.  We had fun.  We went to the coffee shop after the club and the service was fast and the food was okay.     My friends were only up for the one night so the next night I checked out the Playboy Club/Moon.   I didn't like it (see my review) but that's good.  With so much nightlife at the Palms and myself not really loving any of those places I don't need to gamble here to get free or discounted rooms.   :)

They have a shopping area that resembles a blue sky on the ceiling. The rooms all look like suits there huge the bed is so comfy  The service is quite nice no complains on my part. They have diffrent restaurants as well and the pool along with tao night club was nice.
TiKDMbodw8ysADsrgcK8Vw,n_d7HDsTdLc9IWwuPHBNlg,0.0442477876106,4,I would really rate this place a 4 1/2  but you have to choose and it's hot and sweaty today  so I'm going with the cranky option.   Speaking of cranky  one of my quarrels is that you never know what kind of mood the waiter will be in. Never actually rude  but sometimes pleasant and sometimes looking like he was wishin' he was someplace else. We all feel that way  buddy  but you are working for tips and you need to be kissin  butt the like the girls do.   Having said that  I have mostly praise for the food. They have  hands down  the best tzaziki dip I've ever had. It's creamy  tangy  and enhanced with just a little kick of ouzo. Mmmm! (Maybe the fact that they were out today is what's pushing my cranky button. That and the fact that they could break loose with a little more pita to accompany it. Don't be cheap  especially with bread)!   They also have actual Greek salad; by that I mean NO LETTUCE! Yes! They also have the option with lettuce  if you don't know any better  but today they served it without  the dressing. Not docking them because it wouldn't have hurt the wounded parties to just ask for some  but still!   Gyros are tasty and filling  the chicken and rice is enough for two meals  and the fries  both regular and Athenian  are always hot  fresh and crispy. (As in burn your tongue). Baklava is stuffed with nuts and plenty to share  but don't try to get any of mine!   My only real quarrel is the saganaki. This classic dish of flaming cheese needs to be flaming. What a disappointment to get a slab of it just breaded and fried. (OK  I know that sounds good  too  but you'll have to trust me on this.) Still  I highly recommend this place. Just put a torch to that cheese and I'll give you that other star.

I actually heard their veggie burgers weren't that great about a year ago and so never ventured in there  recently I had a coupon and decided to try it!. I think when they first opened they were using veggie patties  but now it seems they are making them.  I was definitely impressed!  Also love the outdoor seating area - it has a great view of uptown.

VT_KEsXqktFW7Ps1NraT8g,lR9xjHv_xhFS4mW3Glm6QA,0.00975609756098,1,We have been a fairly regular customer at this place for a while. Over our last 3 visits  their service quality and food have deteriorated significantly. Today's visit was the last straw. We sat at our table waiting for basic drink orders to happen for about 10 minutes. Then our food in general arrived much after other larger groups who had come after us. To make things worse  the Kali Mirch ka paneer was completely under-seasoned. They put some undercooked paneer to pass for a tandoor dish with some sprinkled chat masala. We have had this same dish here before and it was my wife's favorite. This was basically nothing like it. Then their spring dosa which I ordered had undercooked cabbage with large pieces of carrots  completely skipped the part where these vegetables have to be finely chopped before stuffing them. Again  no seasoning or salt either in the stuffing for this.   My favorite at this place used to be Mirchi Ka Salan  however after the last debacle of breads and food orders  I was hoping for a simple south indian meal thinking they cannot goof it up. I guess I was wrong.  I don't think I will go back.

Service at the door is ok.  Service at the table slow  and slow deliver of requested water  and ... of our food order.  The food was perfectly good--except it was luke warm.  We thnk it was sitting up there.  The restaurant was not busy  and not even half full.  Yet the tables across from us were left dirty and unbussed the entire time of our visit.  Very unappealing.  Mostly the food delivery was slow  the male waiter was slow  the food was luke warm.  Scrambled eggs were way overcooked and crumbled into small pieces.  Brown all over as in extra well done.  We did not complain.  We just will not be coming back.  I predict this chain as closing in the future--and it wont' be because of the economy  it will be because of mediocre service and staff.  It will be like what happened to Marie Calendars.  See ya!

C0UY1f2BUUmLdmB3sn5_lw,iRkmwaLjMRNmWztxHdUtUg,0.0415224913495,4,It's summer time I've been trying to enjoy the various parks Vegas has to offer. I love Sunset Park though I haven't enjoyed the newer sections of the park yet.  They're still renovating the place off and on so some parts are closed or look messy.  But from what I remember what the park was and what the plans are I love it. It will get a 5 once everything is open.  I'm glad they're finally utilizing the area between the main park and the park on warmspring.  I use to run on the unmarked paths just because I wanted to explore some but I felt like I was trespassing.  At least now there are trails  maps  shaded structures  and a little more planning and organization going on. The other night I didn't notice any lights that were on around the running paths or even along the back roads of the park so please watch look out when running and driving.   I remember there being these obsticles along the paths so maybe they're still there.  I also remember the large duck pond having a stinky smell to it.  Again from a few years back.  They still have bunch of sand vollyball courts towards Sunset and 1 along Eastern towards the Warmspring.  They still have the fresbie course  tennis court  kids playgrounds  baseball fields.  And a filty basketball court which does the job with a lot of hoops but you will get dirty bring a towel or something to whip yourself down from all the dirt.  They have a duck pond with I've seen people fish out of. Lots of area for grilling  hanging out  enjoying some air and sun outside.
SYXfCX5djD3JrQcJ2WZDIw,vPJ4iCOSuxCxHPtb18gwWw,0.121621621622,5,Bored of Cupcakes? I sure am. Try this spot! Here's what's awesome. The cakes are super moist  better than a cupcake. And the frosting...that's the kicker. Cream cheese frosting that isn't overly sweet and overbearing  like most cupcake frostings are. On each of their cakes  this cream cheese frosting actually compliments the cake. I never have to wipe any off  as I do with cupcakes. They have mini cakes which are good for 2 (or 1 if you are a piggy like me) and a mini-bundlet which is basically the size of a cupcake (but way better). The red velvet cake  the chocolate cake  the cinnamon  lemon  all of them are just divine. Buy one for your birthday or any special occasion or just as a treat for your kids or group of friends. They will be Smiling for a long time.

The coffee here is always superior to Starbucks and vastly superior to many independent coffee purveyors.  CBTL maintains this standard through consistently good quality ingredients and standardization of procedures.  That said CBTL does not have outstanding coffee  but rather products that never disappoint in an environment that is always welcoming and friendly. The staff here and at the Scottsdale location have always been very polite and professional  while still being welcoming.

You can watch them baking everything as you stand there waiting to order - it's a special experience.   Try the soups as well. The quiche also was incredible - maybe the best I've ever had.   I wish they would open one of these in San Francisco!

The sopapilla tasted bland. No flavor  no texture  nothing. I would've enjoyed a KFC biscuit a lot better. My girlfriend was having hot flashes in the smoldering restaurant. The New Mexican art they had on the walls were tacky and not art. From Mexico with love :)

The hotel staff is friendly  and the hotel is clean. The pool is a good size; perfect for families with kids  as well as adults. The Siren show is a good watch  and is right outside of the hotel. The only place we ate at in the hotel was Francesco's  a pizzeria. The pizza was good  and the price was not bad either! All of the other restaurants seemed to be busy at all times  which is a good sign. I wish we had more time to try the other restaurants in this hotel!
gZrhBF90vlBvBycEvN9OgA,JxgoluY8hnC34cys_f80xA,0.112068965517,4,this place is bit hard to find. It is worth it. The prices for food and drink are pretty good. A place that is more sports bar and has requesite drink and food specials. I'm giving this place an extra star for having sake  in a bottle  in the reachin. It can be warmed up and excellent price forsake bomb $7.50 = 2 or 3 bombs. Karaoke on Saturday nights. I might have sung a Turtles song  but our group sang along with those standards - Bohemian Rhapsody. Cheers to the guy that did Dennis Leary's I'm an A$$hole. Yet  tell your friend.

KkEFlQAmrKf6BtPVi6EU7g,dAMoHX6zBR4uvwKx6SetmQ,0.0869565217391,4,I came in here looking for something other than a typical Las Vegas buffet and found J.C. Wooloughan. It is a quaint Irish pub that serves great food!   My husband and I found this cozy nook to sit in that had it's own television. It's nice having privacy after a long day at work! The inside is practically all dark wood . It looked so warm and inviting It made me feel like I was stepping in from the blistering cold into a warm cozy pub. We all know it was like 109 degrees outside though!   The waiter stopped by to get our drink order. I asked for Mountain Dew he gave me Sprite. My husband said they might have not had Mountain Dew and just replaced it with something equal . In my book nothing is equal to the Dew! I found out later while we were paying our bill that they do have Mountain Dew! It's okay though the waiter was tending bar too so it was an honest mistake.   The appetizers looked yummy so I ordered those instead of a full meal. I started with the Potato Croquettes which were like fried mashed potatoes . They served them with Ranch sauce and their home made mustard. The mustard was really good!   I had the Pretzel which was okay it was like the ones you get at the movie theater. They served it with what tasted like a beer cheese sauce. I found myself dipping more into the mustard then the cheese sauce. The sauce tasted too bland for me.   We ended the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding . It was plum cake drizzled with warm butter toffee and served with candied walnuts and Devon cream. It was delicious!   I would want to come back and try their other offerings on the menu like their Steak Tips or their Corned Beef and Cabbage. I'm always up for something new!

A-10oCwm2KwKmpnciAyr-Q,KpZLxHrp2PIP8tLBsPLiww,0.0780346820809,5,I needed to set up a room for the boys prior to my wedding  and after doing a lot of research this was the best bet.  Pros: -Best bang for your buck in LV  especially using AAA discount for these factors:  - Lots of space  we rented a two bed room suite (basically a connected Junior and One Bed room Suite) that gave us something like 1500 square feet for only like $300/night+tax total (weekday rate). That's crazy considering we had 4 queen beds  3 bathrooms  a full kitchen  etc.  -Clean -New appliances etc -A BALCONY!!! -Nice strip view  -Not too far from the strip  like a large block.  -Quieter than main strip hotel casinos.  Cons: -No Smoking  we don't smoke regularly  but when we party we like to enjoy cigars  and sadly no smoking even on the balcony :( -There is no Casino in the hotel  you have to walk to MGM which is pretty far from all the complaining from the boys I heard. -Not on the strip  so if you're in lazy mode  you will have to pay for taxi.  Overall: -I doubt you'll find as nice as a hotel  with rooms as large and as accommodating for the same price anywhere in Vegas that close to the strip. -However given the above  if the room truly doesn't matter to you  you can spend the same or even less and end up on strip  but don't expect a full kitchen or nearly as large or as nice of a room.  Anyway  in the future I will still definitely consider MGM Signature. It's a beautiful hotel. The Boys definitely loved it. And hell the distance thing really wasn't a factor  because we ended up using Limos all night (some free ;) from cool places like the Rhino).    If you're planning to party up in a room with a big group  You get a 1500 square foot suite with enough beds to sleep 8 comfortably yet still enough room to party. I highly recommend MGM Signature.

I often come during lunch time and it is better to come here during the cooler months since the outside patio is a pretty place to sit with sometimes an ongoing fire.  Brought my brother here when he was in town  who is a chef  and he was very pleased with his food. He actually got some ideas from his meal.  This is definitely one of our favorites with a friendly staff. Whatever I have tried at House of Tricks is always delicious. Today I had the Salmon with risotto over a salad enhanced with mango - WOW. Also  I would recommend any of their specials  they are always well prepared and taste is always on key. Props to the chef  will come here time and time again. :)
KJDymAcoPiW_vuqthGxfpQ,e-U3s4nPAR0OK4RprleF4g,0.0708661417323,3,Have to agree with Andrew S. on this one - not good  not bad. The location itself is in a strip with some other shops  so this would be a good place to stop off and grab a coffee before shopping around.   The inside is decently set up  but there is an extremely limited number of seats for the busy-ness level they face. They do have some extra seating outside  with misters to help cool it off in the hot summer months.  The staff was nice and friendly. The drinks were well made and tasted as per usual.   Overall: B A decent stop off before shopping the area  but may not be able to find a seat if you are looking to sit and hang. A-OK.

The food court here in the Riviera is literally a ghost town  I cant comprehend how all the eateries stay in business. She ordered a non veg plate that came on a little prison plate with tiny little compartments of food and a big piece of bread. She said it all tasted pretty good and she easily finished it all  and she doesnt  have a big appetitie. The cost w/o drink was over $16! which is outrageous for food court food during lunch. I know this is vegas and eveything is overpriced a bit  but every other eatery had equal sized portions for half the cost  Plus my wife got really sick after eating it

Byn-mFdsvyJvcZXbBMi6iQ,0i0PwU8lpj4evYKQogWxcA,0.00826446280992,5,Real Beer on the Strip! Amazing! When you drink beer like I do you can tell the difference between a place that opened because they heard Beer is now a thing and a place that really gives someone with passion and knowledge control of the beer program. I will be back every visit because I know they will have different beers waiting for me each time. They get bonus points for offering half pours too. When there are this many taps filled with local beers and rarities  getting stuck with a 16oz pour just sucks. The food was great too! I had the Asparagus side and the Mushroom side. The Welsh Bread they bring out with dinner is to die for!
VD4SSsRzAK52j5UHdYPE6w,6LNuxmnwiTvxXEDk06MkrA,0.156028368794,4,A really good place for early morning breakfast. We got there around 7:30am craving breakfast food. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes  adobo fried rice omelette  and a chicken skillet. Everything was extremely good... My only qualm was that there weren't really white chocolate chips infused into the pancakes. Previously we ordered the red velvet pancakes  which were perfectly infused and I still highly recommend! The adobo fried rice was also really rich and satisfying. Wasn't too fond of the skillet personally... not as flavorful  but wasn't bad. We also had a side of the Cinnabon pancakes with the skillet  which were amazing too! And if you're into it  they also have sugar free syrup  which we were really happy about! Overall  definitely will return when we have an early morning sweet tooth! :)
PV5voYSD43Cn_3gHmxG7DA,NDfh7hy6k0JBYHCL93SAkA,0.0899653979239,5,Seven days a week  11-3  Taj Palace has a lunch buffet for $9.99.  Located in the the shopping center on Eastern and Richmar  this new Indian restaurant is rich in decor and cuisine. The hand painted tapestry style wall mural  lantern style light fixtures  and open lighting gives a bright look that most Indian places lack. The service was the best I have had in a long time. As we sat ourselves  the waiter came over to ask what kind of naan we would like and filled our water glasses. Throughout the meal  our dirty plates never stayed on the table for more than 5 minutes  if even that long. Water glasses were promptly refilled at the half way mark as well.   The food was consistent. I found that I did not hate anything  but the tandoori chicken was dry. The garlic naan is amazing. When brought out  it was piping hot and topped with a copious amount of garlic. The line had two different kinds of rice; basmati and a vegetable biryani. They also had somosas that were tasty. The saag (spinach) here was delicious  but did not have the paneer (handmade cheese). The other non-meat dish I really liked was the veggies in the yellow curry. For those who love their meat  do not fret  because Taj Palace offer some dishes for the carnivores as well. The chicken tikka masala was creamy and possessed a deep  rich flavor. The goat curry was tender and not gamey. Do not forget to get a bowl of the kheer (rice pudding) before leaving. Taj Palace's version is not too sweet and has cashews for a nice crunch. It was the perfect end to a great meal.
gBcXdBZ-5Ny8mtKZWt-Bow,ryFMClSAI4OojKqxhujsqA,0.137931034483,5,Paid for the full detail and got a huge discount because of their Sunday monday morning special. They even dropped me off and picked me back up at home  although i did have to wait a long time about 45 minutes for the ride back home. The car came out meticulously perfect. Worth all the money. I tipped them but wish i had extra money to tip the guy who did the work even more because he did a great job. Would highly recommend their detail service.

vQQEubUnIDpTfbjxQY3X4g,66jI6z-JuLasvd692ymycg,0.049504950495,1,I love Toby Keith but if he is in anyway associated to this place you better rethink it. I came in just after one today maybe 35-40 people in the bar  but the place is very big after being told we could sit wherever we wanted is server finally came up after five minutes. Said it wasn't even her station but she was going to help us I was the only help we got from her all day. We ordered two beers 1pint 1mason jar and two waters. It took 10 minutes to get our beers and they were served in plastic cups  I know Tobeys into red solo cups but seriously a Sunday afternoon and they don't have any glasses? The waitress apologized and told us she would repour into glass & told us the bartenders had a busy night last night so there weren't many glasses available   what a joke!!! After 20 more minutes we still have not received our waters nor appetizers and we had no idea where our server was so we threw a 20 down &got up and left.... I will not go back and would urge you not to go at all
vWW-Tybjk8wc3c--dnCo5w,O7X2FExFAj9bTJcOx_rKuw,0.0216306156406,5,Summarized review for those on a time crunch: *Great staff running the gym  attentive to all questions. *Experienced coaches with emphasis on form correction. *Location is huge with updated equipment; They purchase new stuff as they grow. *I was fat; I'm less fat now and lift heavy things. *Changing from a regular gym (LA Fitness/Golds) to CrossFit was a game changer; Provided me with the accountability I needed to push myself and hit goals and coaches that helped me get there (without injuring myself!)  Full review for those wanting more information: I joined last May because I needed to change my workout routine. What I was doing simply wasn't working anymore and the accountability to put in the hard work wasn't there while going to a regular gym (i.e. LA Fitness  Gold's  24 Hour Fitness). I didn't know anyone from Cactus CrossFit so I was jumping into a world I had no knowledge about.  My Experience: I'm a 28 year old male  6'2  215 lbs. Since I joined I have improved almost every measurable attribute of myself over the past 10 months. I lost 17 pound and hit under 200 pounds for the first time since college while increasing my strength regarding my lifts. I had horrible cardio endurance when I began  gasping during every grueling workout  while I'm still getting my butt kicked every workout I feel my endurance during my cardio workouts has greatly increased. I'll never be one to knock the traditional gym atmosphere but Cactus CrossFit is my new home away from home. I've found a new outlook on fitness and health  while surrounding myself with some amazing people that have made gasping on the floor in accomplished agony a fun experience.  Staff: I don't have a negative experience with any of the staff. They are always there to answer my question and provide me with the resources I need. As for the coaches one of the main complains you hear about CrossFit in general is the quality of the coaches and I am extremely grateful the coaches at Cactus CrossFit. They are there to correct my form and do everything they can to provide me with the patience and instruction for me to learn proper form and weight scaling for lifts so that I can avoid injury while increasing my strength. They watch you diligently during the workouts so they can prevent bad technique. I've been stopped many times when I was using weights that hurt my form and have been pulled aside to work on how to fix technique or my mobility on multiple instances. Cactus CrossFit staff is top notch. They are the primary reason I've stayed.  Location/Equipment: Everything is top notch and if they ever have equipment that isn't functioning property or has seen excessive wear they typically have a replacement when needed. They have been growing over time and their new location is huge to accommodate their success.  Price: Comparable to other CrossFit gyms and what you get (i.e. location  equipment  misc perks). For those that have paid for personal trainers gyms I'm not sure how the price could be too much. Even though the classes are as groups I get 1 on 1 help anytime I've had a question.  This was probably too long of a review for anyone to read  but if you did  CONGRATS! You can now hit the RX button in Wodify (which they use and I have no clue how any box could function without it)!",3,3
"Waited about an hour to sit down at this place and expecting something amazing. The wait even took around 30-40 minutes to get our burgers and fries as soon as we ordered.  I got the all american burger and expected a really good cheeseburger. The meat party wasn't even juicy. The one thing they got right about the patty was that they cooked it medium well for me.  I mean  I wouldn't come back to this place again. A lot of people probably come here just for the name. Just wasn't satisfied",1,1
"This is amazing! Great fusion of the best Asian Mexican foods! Something for everyone. Great service even better prices and huge portions! Must try fusion nachos  kimchi fried rice  fusion sliders! Love!",1,1
"Kan's Kitchen has new hours posted and they are 5 pm to 5 am!  So  not sure if they are still offering late night dim sum as an option.  Looks like they are targeting a different crowd now!  Nonetheless  we came a bit after 9 pm and noticed a steady stream of Chinese families there for a dinner too.  They had a Specials menu - all in the Chinese though.  The waiter couldn't do much with translating beyond 'beef  chicken  etc.' and ended up giving us the Midnight Specials menu which is happily in English!  All items are $4.99 each!  Score!  We ended up with:  * Deep Fried Salt and Pepper Tofu ($4.99) - Little cubes of tofu that are deep fried and spicy.  We both enjoyed this.   * Steamed Chicken with Mushroom ($4.99) - A very simple dish and it's exactly as described - chicken and mushroom. * Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodle ($7.95) - This came off the regular menu and we ordered the noodles separate from the sauce.  (Y'know  so the noodles stay crunchy and don't get soggy underneath too fast  Overall  we find ourselves there when we're looking for some authentic Chinese food without all the frills.  Sure  service is what you expect with only one waiter working and you need to wave him down when you want him.  But it works for us  especially when we're given the specials menu!  Update! (12.11.10)  Drove by this evening and they have shut their doors!  Nearby Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli confirmed that they are not CLOSED!",1,1
"Do you like savory foods? Seriously this place offers some really tasty dishes. So far the yellow curry chicken and spicy egg bomb are the favorites. I prefer to pick up order as the restaurant is a little run down. But everyone is very nice and will happily offer suggestions.",3,1
"I saw the olives  however the ivy was nowhere to be seen  just like the real value.  To put it simply you are paying for decore and location  the quality ingredients do not match the prices.  We had a Veggie Fritatta $11 and the watermelon salad $10.  While it was nice that they were able to do split plates  the Mellon on the salad was not very sweet  the mint was tasteless and the chevre cream was not viscus enough to stick to the fruit.   The veggie fritata was decent  the mushrooms were a bit rubbery but the arugula and chevre were a nice touch  but was it worth $11  not really.   I did enjoy the focaccia bread and pesto that came with the meal  but that was  the high point.   The patio looked great  but with the heat and a broken misting system that was a no go.",5,1
"I don't know what it is but I can never really get into any Fox Restaurant Concepts. I've visited Sauce  Arrogant Butcher  True Food  and Zinburger.   I go to these restaurants a lot because my girlfriend's parents love Fox and they buy gift cards by the bushel. Anyway I was True Food the other day and thought I would write a review.  We started off with Chicken Chopped salad  they were out of the Mediterranean which was shocking  (how do you run out of a salad?) The salad was decent  nothing to write home about.  We also split some Edamame dumplings which were the highlight of the night  honestly i should have just ordered two of those for my entree.   For entrees I ordered the Margherita pizza  and my lady order the TLT and we traded halves. The pizza was solid but I wasn't blown away. The TLT on the other hand was actually really good  the Tempeh bacon tastes just like bacon and I would glady order that again.   I've had the panang before and your better off just visiting a Thai restaurant. That's my big problem with the Fox concepts  their menus are all over the place  they have Thai  Italian  American  Mexican  and Mediterranean on the same menu. The food is overpriced and you would be better off visiting a restaurant that specializes in a particular cuisine.  If you like pizza visit Pomo or Cibo  If you like Thai  your better off at any chain  even Thai Basil.  I just wish these places would have fun with the food instead of creating these hip dishes that sound cool ordering but lack in flavor and originality.  Rant over. It's not so bad when you have a gift card!",5,4
"I have eaten here several times  its a bit hard to find if you don't know your way around Phoenix. The 1900's Bungalow is amazing  I like to sit outside on the Patio in the fall and listen to the Music. The service is outstanding. Lunch time is for Sandwiches- order the fruit salad with it.... dinner is for amazing Pizza  Biancos is great  expensive and too damn long a wait  Al Fornos in Glendale is great but too noisy  Cibo is right in the middle  great food served in a unique setting",2,1
"I just switched practices because of how rude and unhelpful the office staff is .  This is by far the worst doctors office I have ever had to deal with.  They over billed me by 800.00 dollars and took 3 months to get it back to me after countless calls and complaints.   If you have the option to go elsewhere    do it!!!!",4,5
"WITHOUT A HITCH!  My friends threw a birthday party for me on Saturday night.  They reserved two huge tables behind the bar area.  It was a great turn out....about 25-30 people showed.  My lasting impression is that they have done this before.  Everything was so organized and flowed very well.  As you have seen in previous posts I love to entertain and have big get-togethers and this venue I will highly recommend.  Our waitress Tiffany was really the only one taking orders if I remember right.  Most all orders were individual and you know how that goes.  This chick was amazing.  She kept everything flowing  remembering where everyone was  who order what and kept handing me drinks throughout the night. haha  The bald guy (sorry bald guy-I didnt get your name) kept the tables clean of emplied plates and bottles which is a huge pet peive of mine.  I hugged him at the end of the night because without him the tables would have been a mess.  My boyfriend ordered a select number of appetizers for everyone....nachos  cheese curds  pizza bites and some kind of spinach dip.  All were fabulous bar food.  Someone ordered the pretzel and I am still dreaming about it.....and then someone else ordered the steak sliders.  Yes we will be back for those!  I must!!!  I must say Dear Draft House....I am impressed.  What a great night!  Thanks for making my birthday special (and to my friends of course)...and I will see you soon for another pretzel and steak sliders....and some beer! ;)",5,5

"A better name for this place would be Schizophrenic Pizza.  Seriously.  I walked in about a month back and ordered a simple medium pepperoni pizza.  Waited a bit  got my food  and was good to go.  Got home  was treated with the freshest  most wonderful doughy (in a good way) pizza I've had in my eight years in Vegas.  I was so happy.  Finally!  I have found a good pizza place in town!  And it's half a block from my new house!    About a week later  I once again decide to get pizza.  This time  I call ahead.  Medium pepperoni pizza  as always.  I notice the box is different this time around  but think nothing of it.  I get home  open the box... and it's a completely different looking pizza than before.  It's like they took the typical every-fucking-pizza-in-Vegas cardboard awful garbage pizza  threw it in a generic box  and handed it off like nothing was wrong.  I took two bites and thew away the rest.  I was so fucking mad I almost went back to throw it at the employees for sullying the name of what should be a great pizza place.  My girlfriend went there last night  and she walked in to order.  And she got.... a pizza much like the first one I had there.  Amazing  fresh  doughy  incredible  awesomeness.  I destroyed my half in about 0.00005 seconds.  It was wonderful.  In summary  this is apparently two different places operating out of the same location.  Don't call ahead.  Don't get delivery.  Just walk in  order the pizza  and leave fat and happy.",2,1
"Experienced my first spring training game on St. Patty's Day with a matchup of the A's Vs. the Giants.  Half my family was in A's gear and the other half in Giants.  First the good.  I really liked the size and feel of the ballpark  felt like there was no bad seat in the stadium.  Parking was inexpensive and plenty of it.  Concessions were good and they had extra people out with buckets of beer and water.  Now the bad.  We had seats in the outfields and the bleacher benches were built for 8 year olds  not someone over 6 ft tall.  Also  there was no grass areas in the outfield.  Overall  I really enjoyed the game  Giants won  and we all had a good time.  I look forward to going to Scottsdale stadium.",1,1
"I would have to say the portion was bigger than what you get a panda but I'm still conflicted with my overall impression. Over floured chicken is a sin in my eyes  whether it's fried hard and crunch or has obvious air pockets from where the flour didn't have a chance to completely stick. It wasn't horrible but will not be my first choice for local chinese.",5,4
"I work with a girl who has autism  and I brought her to the movies. The staff were very respectful and friendly. They have clearly given their employees excellent disabilities awareness training  which is refreshing. Definitely a business worth supporting.",1,1
"Got a new smoker for my Birthday and decided to visit Hobe Meats to do it right. I agree with all of the great reviews and can't say enough good things about this place.  The selection is fantastic  the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful and the prices are great. I will definitely be back!",4,3
"As simply put  mediocre at best. There was so much hype about this place and even had to wait 15 minutes. Why wait 15 minutes when you can get virtually the same thing if not better at other breakfast places? On top of that  my waitress was very slow to serve us.   My friend  girlfriend  and I had already chosen what we desired yet  we waited an additional 10-15 minutes. It was busy but there's no excuse for waiting that long. I got the corned beef hash which was not that well cooked and the hash was shredded way too excessively. It was almost as if I'm tasting carnitas. On top of that was scrambled eggs  which there is nothing bad you can say about standard scrambled eggs. The potatoes were actually quite good. They had some kind of salt and spice that was addicting. But there's a problem when the side tastes better than the main dish.   Overall  mediocre food  below average service. Would not consider this an option for breakfast brunch. I would rather starve and wait for lunch if I had to.",1,1
"This was my first experience staying at the ol' Palace. I must say that if I had a choice I wouldn't have stayed here...because I know the table minimums are not MY minimums but  who gambles where they sleep anyways?  We stayed in a room in the Roman tower and while it left something to be desired it was definitely ok.   I love that the Forum Shops are right there although I do wish the food court in the hotel were...better....alot better. As it was...pretty terrible.  My favorite thing about Caesar's Palace? The customer service!!!!! I got lost like...10 times? Nobody ever got annoyed. The people ALWAYS introduced themselves and gave me perfect directions. I live in Austin so a smile to me means excellent customer service.",5,1
"The owners daughter was rude. She got our order wrong and when I tried to tell her that she made a mistake she snapped at me and my kids and family. ******DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!! I would go ZERO stars  but can't.",2,1
"I go to the lake a lot with my friends  getting jealous because they can wakeboard and I can't. I weight 250lbs so I totally sink their boards. I went to ski pro  talked with a guy and he let me rent a giant board that could hold me up  gave me some tips on getting up out of the water  and a bunch of free wakeboard magazines.  I got out of the water on my second try and ended up buying that wakeboard.   Some of their stuff can be wicked expensive (but high quality).",1,3
"They had my name in a menu selection  how can I not be a fan! :)   This place is really neat. I have never been to a Cracked Egg before in Vegas  and I am happy to have popped that cherry at this location. I would love to go back and try some other things I was eyeing. I just could not make a decision  but I settled for an omlette and it was good!   It felt like a country vineyard type place. It was just very charming. Our service was not bad  just rushed it seemed like. Maybe they need to hire a couple more people in the morning rush of the weekend!   I would like to try more stuff  so I shall be back!",4,3
"Friendly technicians. Good pedicure  but with a lot less massage than I normally like. The manicure was extremely rushed though. My cuticles were still very messy and I had paint all over my fingertips. It was a gel manicure so the paint came off my fingertips after about a day of me picking it off  but for the price I would have expected more. Both manicure and pedicure did last well though. I've had them for about a week and a half and not a single chip.  I'm not from the area  so I probably won't try this place again.",4,2
"Horrible service  horrible management.  food mediocre...and watch out for their site specific rule of only 3 alcoholic beverages.  This is the only Texas Roadhouse with this rule...doesn't matter the size or strength of the drink..you only get three so drink slowly! Won't be back...",1,3
"After months of my friend wanting to take me here  I finally caved and checked this place out. If you've been holding out like me  stop... now. This place is fantastic. Hands down the best ramen I've had in Arizona. So many options and if you are feeling adventurous  give the big bowl challenge a shot. Even the house cold sake was good. Why are you still reading this  go check this place out.",3,3
"I love this restaurant. The ingredients are fresh  and the food is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite lunch menus of all time....of all time! (haha kanye) But seriously  go to this restaurant and try the orange chicken (the best in town) and also the spicy kung pao chicken is delicioius.",5,5
"The Bellagio is top notch! This is the only place we stay when in Vegas. Comfortable  elegant  and a great location on the strip. The pool cafe has great food for lunch. Bellagio is definitely the place to stay when visiting Vegas. You can't go wrong with this choice!",3,2
"My most recent visit was not my first visit. Actually  it is among quite the few. Brio has been a pretty good go-to restaurant for a nice sit down dinner with a variety of meat or pasta choices.   I was introduced to Brio about 5 years ago. And it has yet to completely fail me. Even with a recent experience of not mine  but two of my friend's Rack of Lamb order  they had messed up the temperature on the meat twice. One returned to the waiter  second time  even the manager and chef had come out. GREAT service and customer satisfaction.   My most recent visit was for a friend's graduation party. She had made reservations a day prior. Upon arrival  took maybe 10 minutes from arrival to having table ready. Not bad? Had came here for my b-day as well last august  and it took about the same amount of time for getting table ready.   We were seated in the back room (first time sitting in that room) in a 7 person round table.   At first  service was pretty good. Quick for drink orders and first round of bread came pretty fast. But went downhill from there. I had asked the waitress for more bread. My friend had asked another person for more bread. Because we had 7 people  the first round's two bread baskets disappeared fairly quick. Let's say  all our entrees came out  and was more than 1/2 way through it before one new basket of bread came out. Could easily say it was at least 30 minutes. This was just bread. If the bread is being baked or not ready  at least tell us ! The bread was good too ! first round of bread  nice and hot. i wanted more ! *sad face*   I had ordered the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina (14 oz. Strip Steak served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables) - $28.45 - Seasoned well. Meat temperature was perfectly medium rare  like i had ordered. Mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. Roasted vegetables were... well... roasted vegetables. Lol. The one thing i dont understand about restaurants is why do they insist on using serrated steak knives? Not only do they rip through the meat  requires extra force to hold down the meat so it wont move while the serrated edge rips through..... Im not sure if its a safety thing or what... id much prefer a sharp non-serrated knife that allows me to cut through cleanly. Even if the meat quality is low and not cut through like butter  it still wont rip through... just make me make a few more passes before it cuts through.. personal little irk that bothers me i guess.   One of my friends had ordered the Brio Sliced Steak Salad (Mixed greens  tomatoes  Gorgonzola  mushrooms  candied pecans and creamy horseradish dressing  topped with grilled tenderloin and a balsamic glaze) - $15.95 - chopped greens topped with a tenderloin. Salad itself looked good and wonderfully dressed. The amount of meat she got was very little. I dont know if it really is a tenderloin but dang... i'd estimate the amount of meat that was there to be maybe 3 - 4 oz. For such a big salad  it was quite... tiny   In previous visits  i have tried the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca as well as the Roasted Lamb Chops.   Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca - (Perfectly seasoned topped with Gorgonzola. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.) 8oz filet $29.95  14oz strip $28.95 - essentially the same as the above listed Bistecca Alla Fiorentina but topped with a gorgonzola crust. Adds a nice flavor but the seasoning on the crust plus possible seasoning on the steak may double up and be a bit salty.   Roasted Lamb Chops (Full rack  perfectly seasoned New Zealand lamb chops  with red wine veal sauce  mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) - $29.45 - when done right  perfectly cooked and seasoned. tender and juicy. you get i believe 5-6 lamb chops. decent size. great for lamb lovers who may not want a steak. good alternative.   Overall  despite the occassional lack of service  its still a favorite place to go among myself and some friends.",2,3
"AMAZING!! My husband and I dined here for my birthday this past weekend and although I was at first let down by not getting a view seat due to a private party  the food more than made up for it!   We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Chilies appetizer which was recommended to us by our waiter after attempting to order the Crudo Roku sashimi tasting. He said it was much better  and it was actually a few bucks less so we took his advice and loved it! The chilies added a great flavor to the Yellowtail and the presentation was great.   We then moved on to the Shima Roll and the Albacore with Scallions cut roll. That Shima Roll...OMG...pure heaven!! I'm pretty sure it is the best roll I've ever had!! The combination of textures and flavors was pure perfection.  The avocado was so soft and ripe  the tuna was buttery and wonderful  and the cilantro and little dab of hot sauce added just the right amount of zing. The Albacore was also wonderful as were the subsequent items we ordered  the Live Halibut sushi and the Toro & Jalapeno Roll.  We enjoyed a carafe of sake during our meal and indulged in a few sake bombs before I finished with their wonderful Lychee Martini. I was then surprised with an awesome chocolate souffle birthday dessert! I was so stuffed already but managed to polish it off!   The service was great as our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Though the prices are indeed a bit high  I felt it was worth it for the wonderful food  ambiance and service. We look forward to coming back to Sushi Roku the next time we're in Vegas and will also make it a point to try out the other locations in LA next time we're up that way! We've dined at their Katana Restaurant in Hollywood (see review) and loved it equally as well!",2,2
"It was my first time here and I will have to say it I really enjoyed the outdoor venue. The service was awesome  even though they were out of a couple of beers and no spinach on my pizza.  Its a very chill restaurant and potential for a good hang out place.  My southend pizza was pretty good and I look forward to trying the other menu items.",3,1
"Went for breakfast.  Had the pancake stack  left disappointed.",5,5
"Bicycle Ranch is an excellent place for both the novice and serious riders alike.  I think it may be a little intimidating to the non-riders  however the people that work there are extremely friendly and helpful so don't be afraid to ask!  I had a semi-custom bike built there and couldn't be happier with it - and their service department has always done a great job doing quality tune-ups that are timely and reasonable.  Highly recommend.",5,5
"First timer- just moved here and have been searching for a good east coast pie. Food- GREAT  service OUTSTANDING!!! found my new joint and will spread the word. Thank You!",4,1
"I haven't been to Ritos in ages but I had to try my favs..red mix enchilada style with a side of rice and beans! The beans are the best in town! So flavorful! Red chili is spicy but not overwhelming. The rice is tasty all by itself but mix it with their hot sauce and you'll have a party in your mouth! I ordered two beef tacos..two words  de lish! Hot pulled beef with lettuce and cheese and put the hot sauce on and you're in Mex food heaven! Bring your cash and your friends! This place will not disappoint you!",5,5
"Wow  things really do change quite a bit in a year and a half!  The service issues are still there but not nearly as bad  oxtail continues to rock my world  goat curry very good  last thing I had here was their escovitch  which was an amazing preparation of fish  it somehow had the sinus-clearing sensation of wasabi with some sour and sweet tones.  Their sides of cabbage  rice  beans  plantains continue to seduce.  Their ginger beer mixed with their sorrell drink just might be my favorite new drink in the last 2 years  its worth a trip just to try it.  4 well deserved star update!",5,5
"Rumor has it this place sucks!   The room was dirty  the hot tub was nasty  the shower was gross  the water smelled  the sliding door didn't lock  the ice machine was broken and dumping ice all over the floor ( the maintenance guy just looked at it then walked away)  the gates to the parking lot didn't unlock with the room keys. We had to walk all the way around the motel to get inside to walk all the way to the back again ( another guest thankfully broke the door lock to we could use the door again). For the  price we paid we would have been better off at a motel 6. Luckily we were able to checkout a day early but what a dump. I don't want anyone staying there even if I hate them.",5,5
"I'm a big fan!   I first tried Salon D'Shayn on a groupon-type-of-deal whim over two years ago and I've been going to her ever since - mostly waxing  but occasionally other services  too. I recently switched over to her new midtown Phoenix location when it opened in January 2013. Between the easy online scheduling  the great location near places to eat  and now only being about a mile away  it doesn't really get any more convenient for me!  I also really like the new location because it offers nail services. The nail techs are nice gals and there are plenty of polish options (I'm now a fan of the CND Luxe line - think 7+ days like shellac without the need for a base coat or UV lamp). Affordability is key for a non-profit professional like me who likes to treat herself to a mani or pedi every now and then  so I like that the nail services and experience are high quality while the prices are on par with the nail shoppes you'd find next to a grocery store in a little strip-mall type shopping center.  What else do I appreciate about Salon D'Shayn? The refreshments - water  tea  coffee  wine and little assorted snacks. The clean bathroom - 'nuff said. D'Lisa's impeccably prompt service - unlike my dentist  or doctor  etc. And the quick checkout courtesy of the 'square' - it calculates and generates gratuity options for you.  This salon is regular part of my personal grooming and upkeep  so I'm very glad to have such a little gem in my neighborhood!  PS - Something that may not make much of a difference to everyone  but D'Lisa is generously donating a package of services to my non-profit agency for our annual fundraising event. Not all small businesses can or want to contribute to community organizations  so this just makes her place and her staff that much greater to me!",1,1
"Bought many a cigar at Tinder Box. Despite the fact it's at the mall  I still go there for my cigars. That says something right?",2,2
"Phenomenal!  Everything was sooooo fresh! I had the shrimp  oyters  bacon & egg toast  clam chowder  salmon and steak. Definitely will visit again since I went on Valentine's night and there was a limited menu for the holiday.",4,5
"Run away while you still can! or Order the pizza....I was dumb I should have gotten the pizza! Do not I repeat do not come here for pasta! It is a pizza place which I figured out after we already ordered which sucked especially after eating the gross pasta which came to our table and saw the delicious pizza which went to others' tables. We got here and for a busy place they score for having a place for us within a few moments. The server was super helpful and we did not have a need of anything besides better food :/ We normally go to La Piazza Al Forno but my husband raved about this place and why not? Well next time nope unless it is pizza. The bread was the best part of the meal! I mean its bread you can not ruin that right?   But I will have to give them credit it was the best bread I have ever ate. But here comes the bad part the meal ugh~! The sauce was super water down it felt like we were at a place which needed to save money it was that water down. The chicken which should have been able to basically cute with my fork I had to saw at with a knife it was that hard. I felt cheated.   And then comes the worst part did not finish meal heck barely ate or poked at my hard chicken so I figure order dessert and maybe that will be a winner nope nope and nope! I ordered the Tiramisu it was just as horrible as the chicken the best thing I could think of when eating it was it tasted sorta old like a old gym sock never had one to eat but it just did not sit right. I should have sent everything back but I also did not want to create a fuss rather I guess write a review. So remember people buy pizza from a pizza place and not an Italian dessert they do not know how to cook and or pasta they do not know how to cook. I think a little caesar's pizza was better than this meal which cost us 40 something dollars. Also soooo loud I could hardly hear my hubby let alone the waiter here.",1,1
"The service here is disgusting! Spent over an hour waiting for my food. Just to find out the cashier never placed my order to the cooks! All they did for me was give me a cheap apology. I will never come back!",1,1
"I used to live across the street from BMG in the East Village but never saw them there  so it was fun to catch their writ-large Vegas version. Audience participation makes it fun and unnerving for some. Would be fun for kids--bring earplugs for them (and for yourself the entire time you're in this city).  Highlights include the body-sized flashcards (I've seen this joke in other places now but can't remember which)  animation with physiological explanation  drumming paint  and Ho Ho eating with high stakes audience participation--though that last bit could have been 5 minutes shorter.  Don't sit in the front if you don't like having paint and food spat at you!",5,5
"Like the food but the overall experience here isn't as good as the one in Columbia  SC.  I think a little upgrading and decor touches could help  the food is really more like 3.5 approaching 4 star -- depending on the menu item.  Outdoor seating in season.  Location is convenient to South Park folks  and plentiful.",2,5
"Boyfriend ordered the Cherry Popper Burger well done. Cashier talked him into getting it medium well because you can taste the flavor better. Burger came out somewhere between rare and medium. Not what you'd hope for if you prefer your burger well done. Major fail.  I ordered Berry The Steak and there was barely any meat on it- just a couple quarter sized pieces if that and I couldn't even taste it. The bread it came on was fresh  soft and delicious however.   Cute restaurant though and we want to come back to try other things.",1,1
"I'm going to call this place Plan C.    Plan A..go to Raku for dinner..its too crowded as always and not really in the mood to wait.    Plan B..Ichiza..again..too crowded.  Ok  fine  let's try the new place.  They've really done quite a job revamping the interior of the place.  I can see why they wanted to get rid of the random green walls Sushi Hana had.  They added a private room too and the furniture is certainly more izakaya-like.    The big difference in this place than any other Japanese restaurant in town is the amount of Okinawan dishes they offer.  This is really the highlight of the place.  Okinawan food is pretty unique and different from standard Japanese stuff.  It would've probably been better to advertise that than the Yakitori which Raku blows away hands down.  I really enjoyed the goya-champaru which along w/ the Orion beer was probably the highlight.    The takoyaki (fried octopus balls) was a joke for $6.  I am guessing it was homemade because the ones sold frozen in supermarkets have more tako in them than these did.    We tried a bunch things on the yakitori menu like pork belly  short ribs  chicken thigh  chicken w/ fish eggs  smelt and a couple of other things w/ pork belly and smelt being my 2 faves.    Its not a bad place to have a couple of drinks  staff is friendly and attentive and they are open til 3am every night.  I'm only coming back here for their Okinawan menu though.  BTW...I saw the owner of Ichiza eating at a table upfront as we were leaving.  I guess he had to go to Plan C too.",5,1
"My roots run deep in Philly although I'm a florida boy at heart. I have always loved the steak and cheese sandwhich but haven't been able to find a good one in Las Vegas for a little while. I moved to Vegas 5 years ago and left behind one of the greatest philly cheese steak sandwhiches I have ever eaten. A place called D'Angelo's in a small town called Venice Florida. I have tried many many steak and cheese sandwhiches out here and Vegas and none compare to Pop's.   The bread is always soft and more than enough meat to go around. Throw in the fact they are open 24 hours and booya.   Loyal Consumer of POP's  Vegas Villain",4,4
"J'avoue ne pas comprendre le buzz autour de cette charmante p\u00e2tisserie.   En arrivant  personne pour vous accueillir. On ne sait pas s'il faut prendre une table  commander au comptoir.

La tarte au citron est honn\u00eate  le sabl\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bon mais la cr\u00e8me (anis\u00e9e?) ne colle pas ds le contexte. L'eclair est assez standard aussi.

"I loved hiking here. It is getting a little more crowded but is still very dog friendly. Parking off Coral Gables is a good idea. Lots of fun little trails to choose from but prepare for possible mishaps. Fun to boulder. The shortest trail is only 1.1 miles but there are plenty of opportunities to add on.",4,3
"Got my first cut today at the Root. Emily was fabulous  friendly  and very professional. The appointment started on time  I was offered soda or water and cookies prior to the cut. I loved the inside decor of the salon The place was very clean and smelled great. I like that I didn't feel pushed or compelled to buy any products  but walked away with Diamante Illuminating Volumizer which was used on my hair to add volume. The cut was exactly what I wanted. I knew my hair was in pretty bad shape  and I really liked the fact that Emily was very positive and very constructive on the type of cut I needed.  I am excited to go back in a few months and get my hair colored by Emily.",5,5

The hostesses are friendly  and the servers have great knowledge of the menu items and offer great recommendations.  We decided to order the Lobster and Shrimp Salad  Seared Kobe Beef platter  and the Salmon Caviar.  All great dishes (see my photos)  but portion size is small so if you like to eat alot...this is not the place for you!!!  Your better off at an all you can eat sushi place!  All in all this is a special place to celebrate a special moment with friends or a significant person!  Overall  a great experience!!!",4,5

Service was remarkable and the place was really clean.  I'll definitely be back since I live around the corner.",3,3

"Four stars because...  Tamarind Wings were a bit bland. You got the tang when you first bite into it  but after that  nothing special really.   The Crispy Noodle Nest was superb! This place made it with the light brown sauce rather than the thick white one & didn't have as much seafood  but it was still excellent!  The beef sausage I believe wrapped in the betel leaves were soooo good!   Service was great & they're very clean  always cleans up the plates and trash that are sitting on the table.",4,3
"Eh.  I expected more outta Retro Redux.  With a moniker like such  how can the store be anything but an acclaimed showcase on glorified mid-to-late 1900s chic?    This place looked more like the old 'Wheel of Fortune' set  with my head in a oddly blurred bubble shopping for porcelain panthers and orange acetate couches  with a very bored Pat Sajak behind the clerk's counter loudly munching on X-treme Doritos.  He couldn't have been more disinterested in his job if there were forty nude women parading around his workspace.  I was surprised that other 'vintage-y' stores around Melrose were actually more believable than Retro Redux.  Sure  they've got things worth perusing ... I'm trying to remember  but  they had a Laszlo piece or something else remarkable as far as design goes  but its priced out enough that invading an auction or maybe ebay is a better option.    Their collection of vintage clothes almost seems as if its an ironic joke to see which scene kids will go in and try them on.  I think this would make a great public access reality show.  I think I could  watch something like that all day  sitting on my own early 2000's non-vintage couch  sipping a Pimm's  and crunching a bag of flaming-hot Doritos.  Hey  maybe Retro Sajak was onto something.",4,5
"If you could take all of the mediocre barrique's experiences and compress them into a big turd  that would have been today.  i just don't get the appeal of this place - is it just because every thing else is worse by comparison?  What a horrible reason to like something.    so  it would seem as if Barrique's is trying to present themselves as some kind of euro-experience come to the midwest.  it has a nice  cozy  sit-down and come out of the cold feel.  so  i'll give it 1 star for ambiance.  they do have a (1) decent armagnac  and an assortment of wine  as well as a nice selection of sour beer.  so  that gets them another star.    However  in all other ways  they just suck.  It's typical to get food that's subpar.  so  that goes without saying.  For example  a whole banana smeared with peanut butter and jelly  wrapped in an untoasted whole wheat tortilla.  i hope you understand that that's a bastardized peanut butter and jelly sandwich selling for $5?  that'd be appealing if I was 12  but  then i'd make it myself.  and if i was making it myself  i'd know enough to toast the damn thing  because if you don't  you get a mouthful of cold  mushy dough  without the contrasting texture of crispy  warm tortilla.  Or  how about  a couple pieces of chicken  fewer pieces of bacon  a loft of filler spinach  and enough ranch dressing to make you vomit  wrapped in  unsurprisingly  an untoasted tortilla?  Once again  cold  mushy dough.  Now  look at the menu  and picture this same scenario for every piece of food they sell that is wrapped in the sandwich cliche known as the tortilla.  if it helps add to the visual  imagine the salad greens are brown and slimy.    Today  though  saw a whole new level of not giving a crap  with the gustatory experience that is the Barrique's Breakfast Sandwich.  This delicacy is billed as a fresh egg omelet with Hook's cheddar on a Barriques Breakfast roll.  Add Applewood bacon or sausage for $1.25.  Well  in spite of that description  the bundle of joy I received was 1 single egg  unscrambled  with the yolk broken  and cooked hard  (for the record  it is generally recognized that 3 eggs is an omelet  2 eggs a scramble  and 1 egg is bullsh*t)  cheddar cheese that was obviously process garbage  a wee bit of ham that could have been a scrap that might have fallen off of a what one might imagine a real sandwich to be  all on a miniature hamburger bun.  Now  maybe this piece of bread was generously mislabeled as a dinner biscuit in the chain store it was purchased from  but  that doesn't change the fact that it had the same size and texture as a white castle hamburger bun.  All told  this massive taste sensation had the diameter of a silver dollar  and the flavor and texture of reheated Arby's hot ham and cheese.  It's diminutive size was starkly contrasted against the full sized dinner plate it was served on.  Now  some may say that the cheap price ($2.65) appeals to the homeless person in all of us  but  when you consider it would take 5 of these things to fill your stomach  and your stomach would shortly thereafter vomit the contents back onto that massive plate in protest  the whole thing reveals itself for lie that it really is.  The false promise of the american dream made manifest in the farcical breakfast sandwich that sat in front of me.  And then  to wash it all down  was a burned and acrid coffee  more bitter than anything even star bucks would ever dare to serve.    sweet mother of god  people  get your sh*t together.    Never again Barriques!  I'll be back for your one  good armagnac  that somehow made it on your shelves.  but  everything else is aptly summed up by your own motto wine for the masses  coffee for the people.  Sorry  I'm not into cafeteria food.",1,2

"I just eat there today. The food is OK  I had food from their lunch buffet. The place needs to be cleaned! The floors are black  the air conditioning vents are falling apart (you cannot see that because they have dropped the reflectors lower from the ceiling and painted the ceiling elements black  so unless you really look you cannot see)  check out the chandelier in the place  filthy! I saw a tinny bug walk over the buffet foods while I was helping myself. I am not a picky person  but I will never go there again. There are much better Indian food places around.",1,1
"Barrington's is one of my all time favorites. The staff is great - front of the house and back. Although Barrington's is really expensive (face it) it is worth every penny. The food is exceptional  drinks well prepared  service is very good. I love the pastas - homemade tagliatelle and rigatoni. The PEI mussels are wonderful. Everything is good. The environment is very intimate  very special. There are no inexpensive wines by glass but the wbg they do offer is very good. If you are solo  sit at the bar - you'll have a very nice experience.",1,2

"First impression was nice.  The hostess was very friendly and professional. She greeted us and offered us a carrier for our babies car seat so that was a plus.  She sat us down and not to long after we had our waiter take our drinks. They handed us chips and salsa right away. We placed our order and munched on the chips and salsa which was pretty yummy.  But the wait just to get our food was pretty lengthy. We ended up getting full off of the food because of the wait. So when our food finally came it was nice and hot.  I ordered the steak enchilada mole. One bite and it was so overly stuffed with cheese.  Almost to the point where it made me sick. I could bearly taste the mole.  I Know that I will never ordered this again. I also had the Carne asada salad. It was overpowered with lime. It had no flavor. Another thing I will not order again.  My son had the steak cognac.  I took a bite and it was good they cooked it med rare perfect. My husband had the shrimp and it was cooked just right also and there was good flavor.  If it was based off service alone I would put another star.  Maybe I'll come back and try a different item but so far I was not impressed with my food.",3,3
"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is coming to Montreal. It is within walking distance of almost anything you could want. Restaurants  shopping  museums etc. When we first arrived we were greeted by a very nice employee. He started off speaking in french but when we let him know we didn`t speak french he immediately switched to english without missing a beat. On our first night we decided to venture out to get something to eat and he was very helpful suggesting nearby restaurants. Another employee offered to show us how to get to the closest mall as we mentioned a particular restaurant that just happened to be located in that mall. He kindly walked us over to the mall and directed us on where find the restaurant.   The continental breakfast is sufficient. They have different kinds of bread for toast  crossaints  bagels  fruit  cereal  oatmeal  coffee  juices  milk and a cappucino machine. Whatever food they have down there they ask that you consume in the breakfast room and don`t want you to bring back up to your room. But you can bring outside food to your room as well as order delivery from the various deliveries in the area.  Everyone we have encountered that works here from the front desk to the housekeepers are very friendly and helpful.   I was pleased that the hotel has a gym for guests to use. It was so cold during our weeks stay that we didn`t want to venture out too much and the gym is a nice way to burn off some energy.  Our room was very clean and well appointed. Each room has: *A large flat screen tv with a mix of french speaking and english channels.  *A dvd player and in their little guidebook it says they have a selection of dvds at the front desk that guests can borrow free of charge. (They only have a few dvds and nothing that interested us.) *A mini fridge and a safe which we took full advantage of.  *A coffee maker with mugs and a basket of creamer and sugars. They also provide you with 2 bottles of water complimentary  every day housekeeping replinishes the water.  *An alarm clock that has an ipod docking station built in.  *A wireless telephone. *A computer with free wifi in the room. The computer was pretty much useless. It`s programs are outdated and it is so slow it is hard to even check email with it much less go on facebook. I used my iphone with the free wifi and was able to keep track of facebook stuff and email.   In the restroom is a little collection of nice smelling shampoos  conditioners  hand soap  lotion  body wash  a shower cap and a little hygiene kit with cotton balls and q-tips. As well as a blow dryer and plenty of towels. The stand up glass shower is wonderful  the water is nice and hot and water pressure is excellent. They also have heated floors in the bathroom which was great being we stayed here right in the middle of winter.   Our room was at the back with a view of China town area and a parking lot which I didn`t mind. There was plenty of downtown skyline to see as well.  The beds are very firm but the pillows are nice and soft.   It has been fairly quiet during our stay. I started to wonder if there was anyone else here besides us but I finally heard a few people out in the hallway outside our door heading to the elevator.   I would have given 5 stars but the computer brought it down to 4. They seem proud of having a computer in every room but like I said ours was pretty much useless because of outdated programs and error messages that are all in french so I couldn`t figure out what they were saying.  Outside the computer everything else was superb and I would highly recommend Hotel Le Dauphin to anyone and everyone.",1,1
"Okay I've had it up to here with this location. I've written letters before because they have been out of guacamole  chips  and crispy tacos numerous times. They always seem to be running low on something. This time in particular I went to fulfill my Chipotle craving and the girl preparing the food tells me they're out of chicken o_O I asked her if I could wait and she said no because none of the Chipotle locations in Las Vegas have chicken... Excuse me? Look. I need them to get it together because this is ridiculous. On top not having chicken at any location in town  this chick was rude about it. I'm sure she was annoyed because everyone had been complaining about the chicken all day  but there should've been a sign in front to give us a heads up before we all waited in line for the news. I settled for steak tacos but it was not the same. Guess I'll be taking my money to Baja Fresh.  This is all I got for Yelp but I bet they will be hearing from me.",1,1
"For a Hotdog restaurant tucked into a casino I was pleasantly surprised.   Great snap on the dog. Chili was kinda bland for my taste buds but was good texture/ consistency for a dog.   The Fianc\u00e9 tried the Gyro and loved the amount of sauce they used. I even had to ask if she ordered extra but no it was a normal serving.   The employees seemed angry and not your open customer service how can I help you type. It was very reminiscent of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld and it made me laugh.  I'm sure thats not normal and we didn't take offense but deserved a mention as someone might not be ready for a NO DOG FOR YOU!! Type of service.  Dinning area was trashed but that may have been due to a recent rush and also could explain the bad attitudes behind the counter.  You get a good discount when you book a room at the D so don't throw the coupons away. Its worth a trip with the coupon.",3,3
"I ate at the Elephant Bar last night for the first time in nearly two years.  I have always liked the bar area  and that is where I usually sit.  The beer prices are pretty high ($5.25 for just a pint!)  but much of the menu is now reasonably priced.  I noticed the menu is WAY different than it used to be  with a lot of cheaper options.  I got the Garlic Noodles with Sauteed Shrimp  and it wasn't very good.  It was on par with something you'd get at a cheap Chinese restaurant  but more expensive.  My wife enjoyed her salad  and the service was just fine.  It used to be that it was really difficult to find a seat in the bar area on Saturday nights  and you could count on a long wait for a table.  But last night wasn't all that busy  perhaps because the quality of food and service has slipped.  I'm giving it three stars because I used to think that the food here was pretty good  but maybe things have changed.",4,2
"Randomly came in and was in a hurry. They got me behind the chair right away and out of the salon within the time promised.",3,4
"Wow... I believe! I believe! I believe in the power of food love!  This place is phenomenal! Just go here. Suggest small group (2-4) and go early around 5:30 - 6 pm on weekday or 5 pm weekend. Make it a 2 hour dinner journey to engage everything. And try to sit at the bar (group of 2). the bartenders are very helpful and quick: water  menus  alcohol  food. She held our hand for my lactose issues (described the entire menu and which items could be without milk products) and suggested drinks to fit our tastes.  First set of drinks: Gin's Tonic and Gimlet. Both very good. The tonic was a peach version so it tastes a little different  but good.  First course: special of the night: Lamb salami. WOW. Good portion and perfect starter. Comes on a plate with stone ground mustard  dijon mustard  pickled items  and some seed bread. The meat itself is very lightly salted and a light meat flavor (different from genoa salami  in a fresh way). The accompaniments really add a different flavor to the meat  allowing each bite to be a little different. But my favorite was the meat by itself.  Second course: Fried shiitake and oyster mushrooms. WOW. You had me at shiitake! but the addition of light breading  balsamic drizzle and lentils just takes the shiitake taste to that yummy earthy mushroom flavor. so good!  Second set of drinks: Brandy Old Fashioned and Bee's Knees. Bee's Knees  how do I love you? Very much! Found a new favorite drink in the Mad-town! I love honey  I love lemon  I love Gin! Now I love Bee's Knees! (It wasn't on the menu but the bartender suggested I'd like it after my tendency toward citrus drinks.) The secret ingredient was some fennel/sugary topping.  Brandy Old Fashioned - too heavy on the alcohol burn for my liking  but it tasted decent. The brandy soaked cherry was very tasty.  Third course: house made Buckwheat Cavatelli. WOW. me LEEKy! The cavatelli is a hearty  warm  soul filling dish. But the leeks really made it standout. The pasta is cooked then butter pan fried  tossed with the leeks and some daikon chunks. The daikon is a radish with a very slight sour flavor  which added something unique.   Fourth course: Sea bass. Good. I am not a huge fan of sea bass  due to my previous experience of it tasting fishy. I was raised in the Heartland on cows so Sea bass is what I consider a medium to heavy fish-flavored fish. But we ordered it b/c the other big entrees were just too meaty or too milky. The sea bass was cooked perfect  with skin on one side. The flavor only hinted of fish  but could be hidden in the olive smear on the bottom of the plate. For those of you who like heavy omega oil fish  this might barely scratch that surface. For people like me that likes a light to medium fish flavor  Forequarter does a great job on keeping the fish flavor low. The best part about this dish was the pork chunks - yum! There was also  a potato cake in the dish. It was flakey and thick  but just felt heavy. It didn't seem to do much for the flavors in the dish.  Dessert: Cookie Plate. WOW! I love Macaroons! woo hoo! Did you know macaroons are just little cookie cakes? um YUM! I'm not sure if they make these in-house (I can't believe not)  but the macaroons are just heavenly. The other 2 cookies on the plate are delicious too. All of them go great with the Baltimore Madeira.  After dinner  we were talking to another bar mate and the bartender informed meI did not give you the Madeira you ordered  I am going to give you that one for free. Say What?! Free? Really I wouldn't have known any better and I told her I didn't need a full pour  but would love to test the one I had ordered. The one I had ordered was a Whiskey aged in Madeira barrels; the one I received was a simple Madeira. Whiskey is VERY different from Madeira! I am a Madeira convert! Yummy sweet wine thing! (The whiskey was a strong whiskey burn and smokiness with an underlying sweetness.)  Overall  this place is awesome. 4 out of 5 food items WOWed us. The drinks were great. Depending on your proximity and propensity toward eating and/or drinking  you can easily spend $30 - $60/person.",5,1
"cool atmosphere but food was expensive and lousy.  I would go back just to have a beer  but not to eat",5,1
"Tried Bilbo's for the first time this weekend. Spent many years driving past it to go to work. Wanted to try their food since I've seen specials before.  Upon entering  I must say the place was extremely CLEAN. Might be one of the cleanest bars in town.   The menu was nothing special. No steaks or chicken. Just burgers  appetizers & salads.   Had the Chef Salad. The salad was fresh. had tons of tomatoes (which I was very happy about)  but did not have any personality to it. Was just an average plate.   Prices slightly higher than what I would like. $16 for a sampler platter for them seems a bit high. This isn't Claim Jumper.   Service was decent. Not under-attentive or overly friendly. But it was not a weak point.   Maybe if you want a place that is clean  well lit  & knock down some suds  this could be your spot. If you are seeking dinner  this is not the place.",3,2
"I like the concept of this restaurant. The name is clever  the decor and employee outfits do well to match the theme  and I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate the female server eye candy. Contrary to some of the reviews I've read  we had good service. He was prompt  friendly  and accurate.  As for the food  it was pretty good. I ordered the Cali Chicken. I thought the chicken wasn't quite perfectly cooked. It wasn't tough  but it could have been more tender. Overall  the sandwich was tasty. The fries were decent.  Overall  I enjoyed the experience  but I have no urge to return. I know it's an unfair comparison  but I'd much rather just go to Fukuburger or Red Robin. Those places are cheaper  but you still get that gourmet burger experience.",1,2
"This place is my new obsession.  There go my hopes of dropping weight before the new year.  It started when I just wanted to grab a quick cup of coffee without having to go all the way to Starbucks.  I live in walking distance of this spot so it was very convenient.  While waiting to get my drink  I watched as the guy ahead of me ordered a strawberry-filled crepe that looked and smelled delicious.  My olfactory sense made a mental note and I knew I'd have to make a return trip.  I ended up never even getting a crepe but tried a personal-sized Fuji Apple Pie instead. Lemme tell you when I say  I'm literally a slave to them now.  I find it very hard to resist swerving into the shopping center to check in to Suzuya to see if that wonderful pastry delight is sitting there calling me like a Siren to indulge in its culinary wonderment.  In the last two weeks or so  I've had about 3 or 4.  I even ordered a full-sized one for Thanksgiving and literally prayed that no one would touch it before the night was over.  THANKFULLY  my prayers were answered and I was able to devour the pie all by myself over a course of a few days since Thanks.  (Try it with butter pecan ice cream and you'll be in heaven!)  I just recently tried the Pumpkin Pie and now I'm torn between which is my fave...so I just buy them both. :)   The folks that work at Suzuya are sweet  polite and incredibly gracious providing the kind of hospitality that you only get overseas.  Just going inside  I'm transported to a place and world I've never been to but would now love to visit--Japan!  I count myself a a proud patron of this establishment and wish them all the success in the world.  I'm contemplating stopping by even as I type this... :::grabs keys:::",5,3
"We had four couples  out for dinner during our Memorial-day weekend stay in Sedona.  The food was superb  and perfectly done  in a price range comparable to fine restaurants in Phoenix.  Our server was personable and funny  joking with us during the meal  and assisted by several other staff.  The owner several times visited during the meal  ensuring we were well-cared for  and suggested an aperitif that everyone really loved.  Shugrue's was perhaps the best dining experience we've had in several years  and we frequent some of the best restaurants in Scottsdale  Phoenix and Las Vegas.  Highly recommended!",2,2
"As a Pomeranian breeder I usually groom my own dogs but have been rather busy.... I called prestige and they got 3 of my dogs in the following day... Had the grooming done in about 2 hours and they look stunning!!!! Couldn't be happier and will be referring everyone.... Price is also nearly half what I was paying elsewhere and I love the multi dog discount.",5,1
"I called Car Life for the first time today and they helped me replace a battery that was under warranty free of charge. The owner brought it out himself and he did not try to upsell me but instead told me my options for an upgraded battery which was very helpful information. Although Carlife made $0.00 from me they treated me fairly and provided Grade-A customer service and treated me like a customer instead of a dollar sign.",4,4
"Argh yelp when will you give us the half star because legume so deserves 4 1/2! We visited for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. We had tried to stop once before for lunch but be advised they do close between lunch and dinner  so this was our second attempt at lunch here. I love the vibe in this restaurant! The tables are gorgeous and comfortable. Service was exceptionally friendly. Our server seemed to know the regulars at several of the tables and greeted them with hugs  which I loved watching!  We ordered nettle soup  the housemade kielbasa and pierogies  and the BLT. I had never tried nettle soup before and it was delicious. Very light and summery and I adored the antique little cast iron crock it was served in. Points for original presentation. Chris's BLT was humongous. That thing was loaded down with ingredients and the bread was amazing brioche bread. The only downfall was that the sandwich was loaded with so many flavors that you almost lost the bacon. It was definitely there and a perfect texture addition but the flavor got a little lost in the mix. Not a problem though because all the other flavors were so amazing! The kielbasa was fantastic and the pierogies definitely weren't mrs. T's thank god! (Seriously though restaurants that serve frozen pierogies in this area  it's a sin. Stop it. Log cabin I'm looking at you). We switched meals halfway through so we could both try each others lunches. They only lost 1/2 a star because it took a really long time to get our food. We were there for almost an hour and a half. But our glasses were never empty and our server kept checking on us and updating us. Not to mention that he dealt with a different table complaining about their blt not having any bacon (after they are the entire sandwich! Really you didn't notice? Sounds like someone wanted a free meal to me) very professionally and courteously. He was a pro! Can't wait to try out dinner!",2,2
"This place was a find I watch triple DDD and I was NOT disappointed!!! Great service and I love love love their burgers  my daughter love the grilled cheese and veggies. I go back every chance I get do not have enough   Great things to say about it except TRY IT AND U will never find another burger like it",4,1
"I love this food and the General Manager April.  She is a very caring person.  She is not fake like a lot of General Managers she cares about her employees and jokes around with them at times I have seen it which makes it feel more friendly and relaxing.  You can enjoy your food better. We will be back more often.  You have to try the heavenly delights so wonderful.",5,5
"They don't have the largest menu selection  and the food's pretty average.   We mostly like going for breakfast  not for dinner  due to the better selection.   There are the usual choices  but everything is done well  with hearty portions.  If you want to mix it up with healthy options like fruit  they can oblige.  The sausage is thick and not greasy  and the country potatoes are too. Strawberry lemonade sounds better than it is since I don't think it's freshly made.",4,5
"A vacation away from Vegas! My wife and I love coming here. Every time we come we feel like we are on vacation in a different town  even though we are still in Vegas. The food is delicious  the coffee is excellent  and the setting is very nice. In cooler weather we sit outside and it is very relaxing. Their omelets are delicious but HUGE-I think they use 6 eggs. I am a big guy and a big eater and we always split the omelet and I'm still stuffed. The bread that comes on the side is hot  doughy  and delicious with the side toppings. Their Mediterranean Omelet is my absolute favorite. Their pastries are also to die for  the Charlot I believe is my favorite. This is where my wife and I go when we want a relaxing  romantic Sunday brunch.",4,3
"I recommend this place due to the cheap combos  cleanliness  fast service  quality of food  and the wide variety of the food. I go all the time with my family and it's always just as great as the time before. It's rare to actually find real Mexican food but Federico's has it 24/7!!!",1,2
"Food: My local friends love this place and we came here to eat after running a local half marathon. I ordered the pho dac biet and some Spring rolls. As for the pho  I've had better. But it was decent. The broth was kind of lukewarm. I prefer my pho piping hot. They use pretty big bowls here. Even though the price of lime has recently skyrocketed  they still gave us plenty of lime wedges. The Spring rolls were pretty good. They sure used a lot of lettuce.  Service: Service was good. They kept checking to see if we had water.  Location: Parking was easy and plentiful. It's nice to eat at a restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.",1,1
"Yep. Real BBQ  solid beer selection and professional service. Best BBQ I have had in the Southeast. Their brisket is as good as any I've had in Texas and Oklahoma.",3,2
"I come to this place every time I visit Vegas.  The beers are good. The food is great and reasonably priced  My personal favorite is the pesto cilantro pizza  but I have really liked everything I've had there.  It is a really fun place to hang out at the bar.  My favorite bartender there  Mike  is quite the  charmer.  It's always nice to be flirted with  even if you are old enough to be his..uh.. slightly older sister.  I had to take away one star because the kitchen and bar close way too early.",3,3
"These guys make it easy! They are very pleasant on the phone  they show up & do a great job! I've been using them for a few years now & think they do an awesome job! They keep their prices very competitive  simple & no pushy contracts.",4,3
"Had a small problem in the car wash. Had some slight damage to the wheel of my car. Called the management Guillermo  and he took care of everything. Purchased a new wheel for my car that was very expensive. Great customer service on his part. Thank you! Pamela",3,2
"I met a friend here recently for lunch.  They had a good selection of lunch specials starting at $5.99.  Unfortunately  the entree that I ordered was not very hardy in the least.  I got Buffalo Sliders with curly fries.  The curly fries were good  but the sliders was sub-par.  Not only was there not much buffalo flavor  there really wasn't that much food.  I mean  I know sliders by nature are small  but it was almost as if I ordered mini-sliders!  I've been here many times over the years (including a memorable wing eating contest with a couple of friends where I ate 3 dozen...and wasn't in the top 3!) and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed.    The service was ok  though I wasn't asked if I wanted my water to be refilled until we had been there for well over an hour.  I was also disappointed that they wouldn't accept my 'BOGOF' entertainment coupon because my entree wasn't from the regular menu.  The coupon certainly didn't qualify which entrees were eligible or not  and I wasn't feeling ornery enough to fight about the $6.    They probably deserve 2.5 stars rather than 2 stars  but I can't give halfs and since they have been on their downward trend for awhile  I figure I might as well give them the downward grade...",2,2
"I don't get it. Fleur de Lys was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I've eaten at both the San Francisco one and the Las Vegas one several times. Out of my Top 10 Best Meals  EVER  Fleur de Lys held one of those. (Other meals there were good  but not top 10.)  So I had high expectations for Fleur. And I left  wondering if Hubert Keller is actually gone from any presence here.  Don't get me wrong  the food was very decent. But I expected so much more than very decent  I expected great. And the only greatness in my dinner came out at dessert time.  I ate a ton of stuff because I'm greedy and it was my birthday. So  here goes: tuna tacos - beautiful plating. Tasted fine  but nothing to go on about. Agree with another reviewer who said they either need to be smaller  one bite things or less crunchy. mac and cheese - not a lot of flavor and what flavor it had was a little bit weird. Thumbs down. foie gras mousse - this would have been the best of the small plates except it was served with burned toast that reminded me of diner food. But the mousse was really really good. The huckleberries were the perfect compliment. crab and avocado sphere with watermelon gazpacho - I didn't notice any watermelon. I can't say I noticed any crab either. Beautifully presented but not much flavor other than avocado. Very mediocre. braised hamachi - a bit overly salted. It was fine though.  skirt steak with chimmichurri was fabulous. The chimmichurri was the best I've ever had. +1 (finally!) angus sliders - very good sliders  but still sliders. know what I mean? ceci frito - FABULOUS fried chick peas. Nom nom!! burrato - nom! oysters margarita sorbet  orange pur\u00e9 - beautiful presentation with smokey liquid nitrogen! But the concoction did nothing to enhance the oysters. I'd pass. fig jam flambe - okay  seriously?? Keller  wth are you thinking? This dish doesn't work at all.  But the desserts? ZOMG  the desserts were to die for. Using basil  cilantro  etc  in dessert flavors rocked me hard. Get the sorbets. Skip the dinner!",3,1
"This is the store. No snobbery  just great customer service. Just when I thought I would never find a great down to earth store with professional knowledge I found it. I love the fact that I can send anybody to this shop and they always thanks me for doing so. Andy and his crew will take care of a simple flat to helping cable a 8 000 bike and you will still be treated with a friendly attitude. Honesty  kindness and a great attitude is what you're gonna get from this store. No more walking around like a zombie on a bike search or snobby remarks. Great job..Keep it up guys! I'm waiting to try the new Giant Propel and yet need a cruiser to ride to work. Perfect balance! Sweet! Peter Ney Pro Triathlete/Avid Cyclist/And done with bike egos...go to BOP!",4,2
"Good atmosphere  great service  food was just okay.",5,5
"Bacon bacon bacon!!!!! Awesome!!!   Some of the best think crunchy bacon I have had.   Been here several times and each time I am greeted with a smile and great service. The food is always fast and has great flavor. You can really tell that the owners care about service and their customers.   Keep it up I will be coming back for more.  Thank you.",1,1
"We left our dog Chuck here for 6 nights and couldn't be more pleased. We called a couple of times to check on him and the staff was nothing but nice and informative on what he had been up to. On his last day we had him get a spa bath and haircut and he looked just great when we picked him up. I would definitely recommend wiggles and wags to anyone who needs to board their pups. My husband and I even plan on looking in to taking out dog their for training.",3,3
"Been a member here for about five months now  and I have nothing bad to say about the place.  It's a no-frills type of gym that costs $35 a month (a little more if you're not a student)  so don't expect towel service   friendly employees  or virgins feeding you grapes while you're on the elliptical.  I do agree with the previous reviewer  the woman who works there is pretty stone cold.  However  I have no reason to speak to her  so she can continue riding her high horse.  What you do get is a clean  well maintained place with the necessities - plenty of cardio equipment  free weights  machines  a small workout room with equipment and three spin bikes.  All in all  I'm a satisfied customer of Anytime.  It costs 1/5 of what I used to pay at the SportsClub LA  and it has everything I need.",4,1
"Wow!!!  We did the dolphin Trainer for a Day program and it was absolutely amazing!  From the beginning of the day until the end  we were a part of the crew helping out with all aspects of dolphin care  from feeding through medical needs  and we learned so much about these beautiful mammals.  They treated us like a part of the team all day.  The whole crew has so much love for all of them and it showed.  The food was terrific.  Most amazing was the free CD full of amazing pictures from our day so we can remember every part of our day.   We all had smiles plastered on our faces from the beginning of the day through to the end.  Thank you Mirage!",2,3
"Made an appointment last week for SparkleTime Window Cleaning and decided to try them out. Really nice  professional guys who did the job fast and really well. Showed up on time for the appointment  and the house looks fabulous.",3,3
"Good service and atmosphere. The lychee milk tea was delicious and the boba cooked to perfection. We went back the next day and had the coconut slush  which was also very good! Nice little hang out spot for locals and tourists alike! They also serve appetizers.",4,5
"Great. Fast service",2,1
"Wow. This place was due for a good boba place and its here! Clean and good boba; they even have a rewards type thing that I see all the boba places back in California have. I had the taro but would recommend milk tea or Thai tea for first time drinkers.",4,5
"Cozy place with lots of TV's. Very sporty place....Food options look good  also the Beer is priced very Low which is Awesome. The workers are Very friendly and the people are polite    I will be back to the Man Cave Let's Go   E A G L E S !!!!!!",5,5
"A beauty supply staple in the Charlotte area for years and years  Tisun has delivered a huge selection of products ranging from wigs  hair care lines from a to z  weave  hair accessories  and even has a hair salon in the back...........I'm talking full service.  They carry my favorite brand of african soap and the largest selection I've seen of Miss Jessie's hair care products.  It's located in the shady strip mall off of North Tryon  but don't mind that as I can almost guarantee you they have what you need or can no doubt get it.",2,5
"Visited for the first time this week.  Smallish place but welcomign and comfortable.  Has dart area and several TVs  high and low tables as well as bar seating.  It's a little hard to find in the center but it's therere on the SWC of McDowell and Scottsdale Rd  Really enjoyed the beer selection - about 20 bears on tap and dozens in bottles.  They really have a great selection.    We tried the hot pretzels  smoked jalapeno salsa  thai chicken and muffleta pizzas... All we very good.  The place was packed on a Thursday evening but we had great service.",5,5
"I called around 2 today to see when I could get in for an oil change. Three hours later I walked in and got it taken care of. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and informative. My experience was a great one  and I will definitely go back. I only waited for 20 minutes before I got my car back. Fast service!",1,1
"I feel lucky to have found Smooth Move.  I purchased a large  heavy and very fragile glass sculpture that they were able to move across town for me on very short notice and for a very fair price.  I was singularly impressed with their professionalism  attention to detail  quality packing and timely performance.  I would recommend their service to anyone without hesitation.  In fact I will surely use them again when the need arises.",4,5
"Ranking right in between Last Chance and Nordstrom Rack in pricing  crazy customers  and cleanliness  the Dillard's Clearance Center is worth the foray into the ghetto.   They have unadvertised sales every week  knocking up to 75% off of the already reduced merchandise. I'm not crazy about the shoe or denim section but the rest of the women's clothes are awesome! They have special racks that will have dresses or skirts for anywhere from $4.99 to $9.99. The best deals in the store are on these racks.  Return often to check up on the sales!",2,2
"Tony is one of the kindest people I have met and a wonder with animals. He is so good with my behavior-challenged dog that I boarded her with him when I had family in town. With Tony's help my fiance and I are no longer afraid to take her out in public because she is not barking incessantly at strangers.  If your dog needs help  call Tony. He is extremely dedicated to his work and really good with animals. He also works with us to teach us how we can continue to help our dog progress. When we first contacted him I was having second thoughts about keeping our troublesome second pup and thanks to him we are still a two dog family!",3,2
"Purpose: for work  have stayed here quite frequently (50+ nights)  Pros:  - Check In: always pretty quick - Staff: friendly  attentive  and respectful - Concierge Lounge: the food is pretty good (i generally have pretty low expectations for the food served at the lounges) and the lady who works there in the morning and the guy who works there in the evening are such great  pleasant people. [I will edit this when I get their names.] Love the smoothies in the AM! Also  when the Concierge Lounge isn't open for breakfast on weekends  they give you vouchers for their AYCE buffet downstairs.  - Bellboys: very attentive - Location: right in the center of Uptown (in my opinion) and close to my work area. About a 5 minute walk to a central bus station and I believe the train station is nearby. Less than 10 minute walk to the Time Warner Cable arena and not that far from the Bank of America stadium. - Early Check In: has been granted every time I've come in earlier than check in time.  Average: - Clean & Decent Sized Rooms: not expecting too much here as I really just need the shower + bed  - Gym: Cardio & weight room is decently sized (for a hotel). Their pool is a standard size. Yoga mats (+ space) are available. Open till 10/11 PM. - Restaurants: I've had decent food that I can pick up from the Champions restaurant  order to pick up time is consistent (~15-20 min).   Cons: - Rooms: all rooms generally have the same layout / I have never been upgraded to a room that's bigger. I've only been upgraded to a room that's on a higher floor. Also  try changing rooms if you're given the rooms located underneath the concierge lounge. Starting at 6:30am  all you will hear are footsteps and chairs moving around. Lastly  beware if you request a room near the elevator as it's generally near the vending machine/ice room. When they're restocking the vending machine  you're going to have a hard time sleeping through that.  - Occasionally  super loud people can be heard through the walls/doors (but this isn't really the hotel's fault...) - Occasionally booked solid during busy weeks in Charlotte (they host a lot of events and there's the annual basketball tournament) - WiFi: isn't free for non-Rewards members. Also  it's pretty slow for today's standard. - There were ~2 times where the fire alarm went off (not during the same stay though) for no reason (we were never told what happened).    Unexplored: - Parking - The other restaurant (not their breakfast room and not Champion's)...  Overall: I always try to book my stays here if the rates are within my company's allowable ranges. I haven't had too many bad experiences and my complaints are pretty common across all hotels.",3,3
"Gianfranco's food is simply delicious.  I had a fish special (can't remember details at the moment) and it was very good.  But my husband ordered a simple alfredo dish.  He says the true test of good italian is to order something simple  and if they do that right  they likely do the rest very well.  That alfredo sauce was the BEST alfredo sauce I've ever tasted.  YUM.  It's close by to our house  so we'll definitely be going back!",3,5
"Luxor- from the hotel registration  go up the escalator to the right. We needed a quick bite to eat before our flight.   Shared the Chicken Nachos... $15! With tax and tip  we just left a $20.  They were pretty good nachos and a good sharing size but way too expensive for  nachos. Glad they were pretty good but wouldn't come back.",3,5
"I must disclose I have only ever been here for lunch (several times). It makes for a very relaxing place to eat. The dim lighting  fancy wood carvings  and kind waiting staff provide good atmosphere.  They do a great job with their tofu! Also the veggies  the sauces  the rice... yep  they have been solid (tasty) every time. It's definitely not the best Thai  however it's consistency and atmosphere make it a four.",2,1
"Well  after some more explaining  I was finally granted my exchange. I can't really blame target but this copywriter law must be very hard to control. I just don't get how one company is ultra strict and another almost seems to mock the same rule and then there's those that are in the middle. OK  fine  be strict but when a customer takes the time to explain and has a valid reason... At least hear them out.",3,1
"I go here all the time (about 4 times a month) and i have never had a bad meal or bad service.",3,4
"The quirky name drew me in  but the craft beer selection is what really won me over. A personal fave is the Bells Two Hearted Ale  with its delightful balance of hops and malt. It goes fast when they have it  as the taps rotate regularly to ensure fresh options from local and national brewers. The boneless wings are moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The selection of sauces (lemon pepper is my addiction) will have you licking your fingers and counting your lucky stars. If you want to indulge  order the fried pickles--a Midwest favorite  like spears of salty  crispy goodness. There are plenty of healthier options such as salads  wraps and rice bowls. You won't be disappointed by the witty bartenders and warm service.",2,1
"If I could give them a 10 I would!  Came back here and ordered the specials in the back. Best decision of my life.  Crispy Duck Panang - $24.95 - BEST CURRY OF MY LIFE!! I got level 8 again and it was not spicy enough. The Panang curry was life changing. It the creamy coconut flavor was amazing. The taste is indescribable! The duck was cooked perfectly. The skin is so crispy even though it is covered in curry. You get a huge portion of duck. I was so full afterwards but it was so good I had to finish.   Garlic Prawns - $23.95 - OMG CRISPY!!! If you like deep fried shrimp  this is freaking legit. The shrimp are huge! The batter creates an amazing garlicy crispy texture. They even deep fried the shells! I actually liked the shell the most because of the strong shrimp flavor. Comes with rice. Only issue  as a meal  you get tired of it eventually. If this was served with a side of any thai noodles  it would be shrimp perfection!   Warning  prices went up from a few month ago!  This was hands down top 3 meals of my life.",2,1
"I went here yesterday after reading the other reviews here.  I am new to the area  and did not know where to do.  After having a  terrible highlight and color at the last salon I was afraid to try someplace new again.  I had a highlight/ color and cut with Lori.  She was so nice from the moment I walked in.  She took the time to talk to me  and ask what I was looking for.  She knew good questions to ask so that she would fully understand what I was looking for.  Since my last color was terrible   the process took longer than normal  but Lori made my hair look beautiful!  She was really nice and got my color and cut perfect!  I did get the new client free haircut with color  so the price was reasonable  actually less than I expected for the amount of time!  I highly recommend Lori and the entire salon!",4,3
"2 words- Naco torta. You won't be disappointed. Get the guac too. The citrus is a nice touch. If you're really lucky they'll have shrimp and grits as a special. Run  don't walk if they do. Throw in a fresca and call it a day.",4,4
"Unbelievable selection of wine and beer - and their prices are some of the best I've seen in the valley.   Plus  the store itself is beautiful inside  and it's huge! And it's very shopper friendly  everything is merchandised very well and is in alphabetical order by varietal.   Several times a month they host wine tastings (which I believe are complementary)  so keep your eye out for those!",1,5
"Delicious breakfasting with quaint outside seating feels like you're down one of the side streets in Santa Barbara not downtown Phoenix. Hungry hangover size portions means plenty of leftovers for dinner later if that's your thing but it's so yummy you might finish it all on the spot. Rumor has it they make a dinner to match their breakfast feats  can't wait to try it out!",1,1
"In a search for a Michoacan alternative  Boyfriend and I ended up at Chapala's. Side note: how are there not more sit-down Mexican places around?  The restaurant was probably 1/4 full  which always makes me feel weird. I love excellent service as much as the next person  but when servers have too much time on their hands  they hover and it creeps me out. Thankfully  a minimum of hovering here. The complementary chips & salsa were tasty. The chips tasted fresh. There were two salsas: a hot and a mild. They were not kidding about the hot  but it was really good  so I continued to torture my poor tongue :)  Boyfriend got beef enchiladas. They were swimming in sauce and the filling was all beef (no veggie overload in there!). I had the carne asada tacos. Oh wow  were they delicious. They reminded me of street tacos: well-marinated meat with diced onions and cilantro. Nothing else was needed! Highly  highly recommended entree.  It's cheaper and tastier than the Michoacans. We ate for $30 out the door.",3,1
"Breakfast buffet was decent. Food quality was average and so was service.",4,5
"Great place! Came for my daughter's birthday. Table chef was great. He was funny and did all the normal tricks. Our drinks were always full  and the food was superb. Came with my wife  two boys  my daughter and her friend. Six people and the bill was still under $100. Got the steak and chicken combo. Like all hibachi places  they give you the dipping sauces  but ask for some of their salad dressing on the side. That is the best dipping sauce of them all.",1,1
"America's Tacos makes me happy.  From the cute retrofitted house it resides in  to the perfectly cooked Carne Asada that is tender while still retaining a crispy charred exterior - this place is awesome.  They also serve the best beverage ever created by humankind - the Iced Coffee/Horchata.  A great place to bring out of town guests to...",4,5
"I'm so happy that I finally decided to check this place out. I recommend you do as well if you're looking for some delicious food.  The location is nice  but I feel that the parking is a little tight.  Note that there is also additional parking underground!  Eating at Block & Grinder was the first time that I had used the underground parking  not too bad.  I really liked the atmosphere of this place.  It's just the right size for a nice and intimate dinner with a small group of friends.  Of course you can have a bigger party there  but I enjoyed the intimacy I had with my friends.  Definitely check out the decor all around.  There were skillets near the wall I was sitting close to  and at the top near where they display the steaks  I noticed a grinder displayed within the wall.  I just loved looking all around at the different decorations.  I had visited this place for dinner and it was just amazing.  If you are in a group and don't mind sharing  get varieties of the small plates.  I had tried the Pork Belly  B&G Wild Game Chili and the Beef Carpaccio.  The Beef Carpaccio was my favorite  but it was definitely hard to pick which one I loved the most at the time.  This morning  I did wake up craving those Pork Belly  so it made an impression on me.  For my entree  I had ordered the Cajun Bison Burger.  I was super excited!  The burger was good  but I was hoping to have more taste of cajun spice  but I just didn't taste it.  It was still pretty good for a burger.  When I had asked for some pepper  I had pepper and three other selections for salt!  Try it out.  For my side  I had ordered some Garlic Mashed Potatoes and once that hit my mouth  I knew I mad the right decision in life.  Order it as your side!  The service here was really wonderful as well..  All the staff were pleasant and helpful.  You won't see a mean or sad face here.  So my suggestion  if you live in Charlotte  check it out.",5,5
"I went back to Mickey's today for the first time since February. They have changed their happy hour to only drinks....and nachos or something. Half-off all food was their biggest selling point. Plus  they changed their menus  and now they look dumb. I've been very disillusioned by the whole experience.  At least the cheese fries and wings are still delish.",3,2
"This store is the best!  I sold quite a bit of my gold there some time ago and they definitely gave me the best price...more than double offered by other establishments.  They are friendly and courteous and not only would I go back there  but I recommend them to others all of the time!",3,1
"Carmel vanilla latte Dolce  Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e  Nutella late  Green tea late  Brimstone and fire latte Sugar cookie late  Mocha orange latte  Hazelnut late   Tried all these drinks in the course of three days. That's how amazing this coffee shop is.   Also purchased their drip coffee and that is delicious. So flavorful.   Staff is so friendly and helpful. As soon as you walk in they greet you.  Service is speedy and consistent.",2,1
"The food was salty.",1,1
"Not what I was expecting from the typical hipster breakfast joint in the biltmore. In fact the food was amazing along with a great vintage atmosphere that could be considered a mix from the contemporary 50's with some retro 70's to spice it up. The price matched the food with everything being made from scratch along with some of the best country gravy I've ever had! I recommend anyone to go and check out the food  the ambiance  and the very nice ladies that dish you up your food along with great customer service!",4,4
"So I finally went there for dinner. Their pizza is amazing!!! We had 3 different types and all were stunning especially the roasted corn! The crust is out of this world. They also have a great sangria which i had a few too many of.....oops o:).  If you are going to go at night with more then 2 people  I would suggest making reservations and they do have avalet but you can usually find a spot on the north side of Campbell and 40th st.  If you live in the Valley this is a definate MUST!!!!",3,1
"As for the equipment- I don't think it's bad  it has everything you need to have a good workout. The reason why I only give it two stars is because for all the classes they offer the instructors always shows up 5 mins late. Yesterday I was there for a 5:45 class  the manager walked in at 6:05 and said there is no instructor? She than began to give the class even though she did not know what she was doing  but that doesn't matter I give her an A+ for trying. She proceeded to do a 20 minute workout and told us she had to leave (which I do not blame her) and said the substitute would be here in a few mins to finish the class. I left the class and did another workout and guess what..I watched the classroom and the teacher never showed up. I hope lifetime opens up soon around here.",4,4
"I tried the tasting menu and it was worth the $$$$.  Wagu steak. Scallops and dessert. I also had the absynthe.  You must try it.  the waiter was a little slow and condescending but it was fine  I was hammered on absynthe and purple dragon who cares.",2,4
"closed!!",1,1
"Prices are OK  service is not up to par. I think this is why it was empty during lunch in a very crowded location.",2,1
"Wife and I were able to stop by  and try a few things. We had their chicken and waffles  they were OK! I kept on saying to my wife  man I have had this before. chicken reminded me of another time!! Finally hour in a half later  it struck me!!! Chicken tasted just like Swanson frozen tv dinner!!! I grew up on that! So you can take that any way you want! You need to eat the pretzels with no salt. Comes with way to much! The pretzels rolls were probably the best dinner rolls I have ever had. Since I was driving  it was a no beer night! Would like to come back and try some brats and beer. Outdoor patio is the best  on cool nights they have a great fire pit! Plenty of room  Until next time and a second visit!  Later ",2,3
"I have only been here to dance and if there was a live band on the whole time I would give this place 5 stars. That being said this place does have a decent dance floor and a good crowd. This particular TK's has a horrible dj named bizarre. I requested a song to which he replied I don't know that song I don't like country. That becomes more clear as he mixes hip hop beats with country songs. I have been here several times and if there had ever been a different dj I wouldn't write this. It seems as this dj like the bouncers is friends with management. Bizarre needs to go look at your reviews people want more country music!",1,1
"From 14 years old to 20 years old  it was tradition that our families got together to spend New Years in Las Vegas.  Being under-aged at the time  I couldn't enjoy much.  I thought that it was evil that when I finally turned 21  we ended our tradition.  So when I first turned 21  guess where I wanted my first Vegas experience to be. That's right...Excalibur.  I graduated from Midway's Arcade and the Tournament of Kings to Black Jack and all night drinking.  Fast forward 15+ years and I'm still coming to Excalibur.  Minus the all night drinking and gambling.  Pros: -Rooms are cheap.  Not Budge Suites cheap  but cheaper than the Mandalay. -Great comps:  I don't play much  but own their player's card.  I get free rooms from time to time. -Arcade:  When my baby girl and nephews are in town  this is where we go.  -Pool is kid friendly.   -Beer Pong:  Only when family is in.  2 AM Beer Pong gets the competitive spirits up.  -Loose:  Not the guest  but the slots.  My parents win here and they love their slots. -Location:  One of the few casinos on the strip where it's easy in and out.   -Tournament of Kings:  Half price for locals and kids should experience it at least once. -Remodeled Rooms:  Their remodeled rooms are clean and updated.  Lacking the smell of smoke.  -$5 Black Jack -Poker Room:  Small but there's action from tourist that only know poker from ESPN.  -Dick's Last Resort  Cons: -Parking: My suggestion if you're staying is valet and bell service. -Some rooms are outdated.  Could have changed in the last year.  If you're reserving here  ask for their remodeled rooms.  It's a world of difference. -Old:  Needs a serious remodel both inside and outside.   -Eats:  Buffet is just okay.  Upstairs is bunch of fast food that seems to have smaller portions and cost more.    Since I have more pros than cons  I have to give this place 4 stars.  Plus  it's one of my parent's favorites.  Also a place where I am taking my daughter and nephews when they're in town.     PS:  Message for my little girl since it's also her birthday today.  Daddy loves you.  Happy Birthday Honey Bunches of Oats. See you soon.",5,5
"Great Mexican  food ! Great atmosphere !!",3,5
"Might even be five stars  but it will have to wait until second visit.  I'm not usually big on steak houses.  I like to grill  and like my own preparation is better  and it's really not that hard.  I usually can't see spending a lot of cash on something I like better cooking myself.  Flemings is very good.  The filet mignon was perfectly seasoned and done medium rare.  Many steak places I have tried usually under season their meats  which leaves them bland.   They also try to cook them too quickly.   The reasons for this are really customer service; don't shock the customer  and get them their dinner quickly.    Beef should have a fair amount of time on salt to bring out flavor  and slower cooking to keep the meat tender  juicy and flavorful.  The appsy were great.  Salad  Onion soup  and mashed potatoes.    They have some great wine  although I felt they were trying to be a bit manipulative.   The wine list was ranked  gold  silver  bronze  but it was purely on price  not relative to how good they really were.   I had a better cheaper wine  than more expensive.  This is a place where I would bring my own wine  and pay corkage.",3,1
"If you like disgruntled -rude- teens touching money  the register  their face  everything else in the store and then bare handing your ice cream cones  then this is the place for you! Yummmm  bacteria! Oh and getting their knuckles in your ice cream while they scoop it out of the bucket is super tasty as well. Germaphobes beware.",5,5
"The World's Foremost Outfitter. For Real.  The bargain basement is fun for the budget shopper. Tip  negotiation is allowed. Be respectful  but I have had many items marked down an extra fifty percent just by asking!",4,4
"I only gave this a one star because I can't give no stars!  I have been going to this jewelers for years.  Last year I had a ring made with an emerald and several diamonds.  It was suppose to be ready before Christmas.  They got a special order for basketball championship rings.  Needless to say my order was put on the back burner and was almost a month late.  The ring looked beautiful so I overlooked the horrible customer service.  One year later the ring looks like junk.  The white gold is all tarnished and the diamonds have lost their shine.  I went in to have the ring re-dipped.  The general manager Sanjay was SOOO RUDE.  I asked for her bosses information and she just happened to be in the store.  Her boss was even more RUDE and when I complained they both laughed.  I have never been treated in such a manner.  I will NEVER step foot inside this jewelers again!!!  I guess they have enough customers not to worry about their customer service .  Well they for sure don't have to worry about me or my money ever again!",2,3
"Emeliah gives this place 5 stars. She's so sweet  and remembers your name after one visit. She even remembers the previous stories you shared from 3 months ago. She's very caring and really strong.",2,2
"Nearly one of the biggest buffets i been to. Though I rarely ever go to buffets.",5,4
"Wow! Very happy to have found this place. It seems like in Montreal all the vegetarian/vegan places are insanely expensive for what's actually put on the plate. This place  on the other hand  satisfies every bit of hunger I have for under $13.   That aside  it's actually really really tasty and they have plenty of options. It's worth trying and ill definitely be taking some friends there!",2,1
"The yellow curry we got was very good and very spicy for being medium. We were happy with that. The service was very friendly. The Pad Thai however was the worst Pad Thai I have ever had. It had a very weird sickening sweet/sour taste. I hate to think of it  but I think something in it was rotten. I hope it doesn't taste like that normally. It also had HUGE pieces of green onion. I'm talking a 2 inch piece of green onion. It was weird. The worst thing about the place was the stupid hick bar next door. I feel so bad for the restaurant owners. It isnt their fault at all and i don't blame them for this.  It is just not fun to have your table shaking from awful country music during dinner. I wish they would start the Ho down after the restaurant closed.",2,1

"This is a regular date night spot for my husby and I. We like to have dinner there then walk over and watch a movie next door. The food is normally very good  safe and tasty and the drinks are great as well. However on our last visit our waitress totally messed up our entire order and brought us items we didn't order and forgot the items we did order. It took forever to get it right and it wasn't even a busy night so not sure what happened. It was a disappointment as this is a fav spot for us  but better luck next time.",1,1
"It was great while it lasted  but Secret Pizza (otherwise known as 'The No Name Pizza Kitchen') is no longer a secret.  The lines have gotten longer and the prices have gone up  but this is still the best pizza in Vegas.    Try and avoid this place when Marquee is open  because it will be a circus of drunk people  and I've noticed that they don't go as far to heat up your pizza as they do when they aren't as slammed.  But regardless of when you go  how long you have to wait  or what slice you get  this place is worth the wait  ALWAYS.    Oh  and don't be the jerk who orders a whole pie when this place is busy.  Not cool  dude.",1,1
"Ok I think I just found one of my new favorite spot in the city.  Could you please build one next to my place ? Please ?   Vegetarian/bio burrito restaurant : First  know one thing  when I saw that  I was like Meh  I was so wrong.  Absolutely gorgeous little place  comfy and pretty  that's already a very good start.  Sweet potato Burrito ? Hell yeah ! Good ? HELL YEAH\u00b2 Home made raspberry lemonade : MMMMhhhhhh Nachos with spicy good salsa : Nomnomnomhothothothotnomnomnom  all this for 13$  very good deal for something so fresh and good.  I will definitely go there again  and again  and again.",5,5
"Love this place.  Everything a coffee shop should be.  Superb coffee. Smart  funny  calm  skilled staff.  Great neighborhood atmosphere.  Go.",4,4
"Been meaning to try this place for such a long time now & I can't believe I waited this long. I do live on the Westside though so it's a bit of a travel but it was worth it!   Boyfriend & I did AYCE around lunchtime. All the sushi were fresh  huge and delicious! I suggest getting the Chili Garlic Edemame as well! Service was terrific  loved the interior. Just a quaint little place with various Hawaiian decor.  Really appreciated the warm ALOOOOHA spirit  since my boyfriend & I are from Hawaii. Oh  and if you're looking for poke  look no further. Poke Express is next door!  You're welcome. :)",3,3
"What an odd experience. :-/  I seriously dislike the waiting 20 minutes in an order line  getting seated  then waiting another 30 minutes for food after we were seated. Why not just take names like every other restaurant and seat people as the table opens up? My thought is that you're standing in line right next to the display cases the whole time  when it's your turn to order  you've been eying that slice of cake  scone  or other baked dessert for so long that you have no choice but to order it. Will power won out this time - no scone for me!  The food was decent and the service was also pretty good. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich  being more in the average category than extraordinary  I don't think I would get it again. Having to serve my own drink from the fountain  waiting in line for so long to just make our order  getting taunted by all the baked goods  the general chaos of the place  and me personally living so far away (in downtown PHX)  I can honestly say I'm not going to be making this a destination for dining. If you're close by and it's not a weekend  I imagine this spot is a lot less hectic and easier to deal with.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. See you on Yelp!",5,5
"We love Theresa  Mara  and everyone at JATC! They have shown love and affection for our dog Tuco  and treat him like own of their own. I have such peace of mind when I'm at work or out of town knowing he is in such good care. They also have taken care of him when he was sick  even washed and cleaned his towel and blankets. He has two homes now!",2,4

"Superb E-Liquids at highly competitive prices. I have gotten Lucy in the Sky and Melon Collie. Both were absolutely delicious!! I now make my own e-liquid but I can't even compare to their tastes. Composing e-liquid tastes is surely a craft and these people know what they are doing!",1,1
"i will never go back the lady behind the counter that makes the food was rude and out of order by screaming at us because my son was a little loud (hence he's a 2yr old ) not much you can do to quite them up . either way the way the lady screamed at us and made us feel is a reason that i will never be back if the message was delivered better or asked politely that would have been a different story but screaming at the top of your lungs at a 2yr old is not the way you do buisness if you have a kid please save your self the hassle of feeling disrespected and belittled because you have a kid apparently our money is no good there !",3,1
"Absolutely... Freakin'... Hilarious!  We got free tickets for Mac King. I say free because there is a one drink minimum per person which works out to be $13 a piece. Well worth it and more. This is probably one of the best shows in Vegas!",1,1
"Went to the day club last summer in July  and to the night club two nights in a row in October. Place looks nice  and the sound quality is great too. Bouncers were chill towards me and all of my friends all three times I went. If you see a good  under-rated DJ you'll have no problem going back and forth to the dance floor; but if you plan to see a big name like Armin or Avicii  you might want to make it there early. When I went to see Armin at 11pm  the bouncers weren't letting anybody into the dance floor as it was already over-packed. Overall a legit club.",2,3
"Great  great steaks!! The food and service are top-shelf!",4,5

"We had a night out without our little one and wanted to try a new place with unique food  so after checking out some reviews  we ended up choosing Kaya. We made reservations for 9pm on a Friday night  and the place still had a lot of diners. One other person noted how close the tables were  and we agree. We were only a foot or two from a couple on their 1st or 2nd date (and were totally amused by their conversations which you couldn't help but overhear due to our proximity)  but it also helped to scope out what other people were ordering. All the food looked pretty good.  We ordered the jerk wings and we would absolutely order those again. Very flavorful  hot & fresh  and juicy. The dipping sauce was a welcome change from ranch or blue cheese. For entrees  I had the seared tuna (I think the  most expensive item on the menu) with very flavorful lime-y black beans  another creamy green sauce  and what seemed to be fried plantains. He had the crispy fish tacos  and we both cleaned our plates.  For dessert  we ordered the chocolate chip banana bread pudding  and it was pretty tasty. We have a hard time passing up bread pudding when it's on the menu  even when we're full!  The drinks were interesting. I hadn't ever had a frozen mojito  and I tried their mango version. I don't think I'd get it again  but his rum ginger drink was good.  We would definitely come back and try this again.",3,1
"Where do I begin-Last evening 10/3/13 a group of us had dinner at Lola's on Charleston Blvd here in Las Vegas.  My thanks go out to Lola  Hank and our server Lisa for giving me and us a wonderful dining experience.  This group I belong to randomly pick restaurants here in the valley that have good pricing  great environment and not chain restaurants each month.  When I walked in the door ONE HOUR EARLY  Hank welcomed me  I sat at the bar and had a cup of their delicious GUMBO.  Once my other dinner friends came  LISA explained in detail the favorites of the house.  The camaraderie of friends  great food and excellent service will remain  in my mind as one of the best dining experiences Ive had here in LV since arriving 3 years ago from the BAY AREA.  at the end of the meal we took a group picture with LOLA.    Once more I want to thank Hank  Lisa and Lola for such a wonderful dining experience.",5,3
"A great new addition to ASU's neighborhood! This location is new  very clean and kinda stylish even. There is a neat little patio outside that would be a great spot for lunch with friends or even a short business meeting. Inside there are many seating options and it's a decent size  probably able to handle a crowd after a football game or night out on Mill Avenue. I love Chick-fil-A! Just pray and wish and hope you don't crave this delicious fried chicken snack on a Sunday!",2,3
"There's two saloons in the South Hills. I was confused between Cain's and The Saloon of Mt. Lebo because they're both the Saloon. Maybe it's like the Wild Wild West and they're feuding. In any case...  If it were to that angle  I'd be hard pressed to say which one would win the shoot out. I liked Cain's because it was clean  tons of beer choices and good bar food. BUT  even though this place is a little darker  a little more aged as I'll lovingly put it... they had some darn good wings. And beer selection. But those wings. They were crispy  the sauce was tangy and plentiful  plus it was just plain hot wings and they were delicious!  So the joint looks like it may have seen some better days... if you serve me some bangin' hot wings that are making me dream about them later and a row of around 30+ beers on tap  I'm in! I'll be back to demolish some wings...",3,4

"Now yeah   Harrahs isn't the best casino on the strip but Toby's bar & grill is excellent ! One of the best places in all of Vegas hands down. If your there to drink they have girls give $1 shots from atop the bar. Or if your there for entertainment they have a great live band that sings Toby songs. And they even have a nice store built onto it for all things T.K. And of course the food ... They actually have drinks in a mason jars and the fried mac & cheese is the best ever !!!! A must hit place for anyone going to Vegas !!!!",4,5
"Long before yelp  I remember we ended up at this place by chance  as we were catching Carrot Top at Luxor.  I can't remember what kind of burger I had  but looking back on it  I thought that burger I had at that place was really good.  Now  of course we all know what Burger Bar has become and that the place is pretty good.  Have returned on several occasions  which is rare  since I promise I don't live in Vegas. I want try the Surf and Turf burger  but I'm a little scared to change things up from the norm.",3,3
"Absolutely not. My drink was weak as hell. Tastes like sour lime juice and ice. It's decor is great but whyyyyy is everything over-priced?",2,2
"Cypress Street Marketplace is a food court in the middle of the casino in Caesars Palace. It's very convenient  but I'd highly recommend skipping it as a food option.  The atmosphere is actually pretty cool  tables in the middle  surrounded by different food vendors. It's very  VERY pricey for what it is though. To give you an example; I ordered a double cheese burger  with fries and a drink for about $23. Now  if the burger was good  I'd have no problem with this place  but  the burger sucked. It really did. It looked GORGEOUS  but tasted like a gas station burger.  For the price  I'd skip this place  and head on over to one of the many kick-ass restaurants in Caesars or the surrounding hotels.",2,1
"Was in town for a quick trip and was craving good asian food without having to go downtown.  They were very friendly and helpful and service was fast.  Food was incredibly yummy.  I liked being able to pick from several different sides and everyting was so tasty.  Wish I could eat here again soon!  I'll be back.",3,3
"Last year  I visited Madison to see my then-boyfriend who is a graduate student at the university. We decided to splurge on a little frenchy-french and arrived at L'Etoile on a blustery evening. We were graciously welcomed to a perfect table next to the window  with a great view of the Capitol building.   There was pinot noir  gravlax  fresh pea shoots  cheese...and there we were  discussing our future together. Am I going to leave Seattle and move to Madison? Are we going to get married? How does summer 2010 sound? The servers around us were wonderful and attentive  and they also allowed us privacy. The food? Tres bon! Even after living in Paris  I'm impressed.  A year later  we're engaged  planning our wedding for August 2010  and I'm moving to Madison! Merci beaucoup  L'Etoile  pour une soir\u00e9e exceptionnel! I can't wait to return for a Bienvenue \u00e0 Madison dinner!",1,1
"So the hotel & casino are nice. Don't expect to be able to get much reception to your cell phone in here though  if you have ATT or Sprint.   The hotel room was pretty roomy  but I was really disappointed by the fact that there was no comforter/bigger blanket on the beds. It was just a sheet  thin blanket and top sheet. The bed wasn't bad though  I slept alright no aches or pains to complain about. The television is extremely outdated  but we didn't watch it anyway.   I think the waitresses in the hotel could have better/sexier uniforms. Personally  they were more of an eye sore than a person I wanted to purchase a drink from.   The resort fee that you have to pay after you check out is pretty ridiculous to me. Why should you have to pay for things they advertise as complementary?   My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights for a wedding. The reception area was beautiful and the catering was amazing. That was the best part of our stay.  The bowling alley downstairs is pretty cool and fairly priced. Although  the snack bar is a little pricey and when my boyfriend went to order a soft pretzel  the guy told him it was a 5 minute wait. Instead  we waited 20 minutes for a burnt pretzel.   As far as food goes  the Grand Cafe has great food but we realized that we could have eaten at the buffet for a lot cheaper. There was a pamphlet advertising Room Service but another guest that stayed the same time as us were told that they don't deliver the food to the rooms. So much for ROOM service  hah.  Next time I visit Vegas  I will be staying somewhere else.    P.S. If you plan on having a wedding reception here  they charge you a ridiculous amount for champagne. If you bring your own champagne  there is a $9 fee per bottle opened.",1,1
"I have lived in this area before and actually played the TPC course and never thought to get food here until a friend of mine said they had a new menu and it changed its look to a Gastropub and they stocked up on local beer said it was really worth checking out. So I decided to go check it out and usually i just get an entree but i decided since it was a new menu to go through the motions you know appetizer  entree  dessert. Lets start with the appetizer Duck Confit Tacos.....OH MY GOD these were amazing and if my meal was gonna start out like this my expectations just got a lot higher cause these are worth getting. There was 4 small tacos great to share with someone or if you are like me and can take down some food a good starter. Now for the entree Deep friend Lasagna which once again blew me away and later i found out it was a recipe from one of the chefs grandmother which instantly means its gonna be good so being that i am a big eater I took that down without a problem and almost skipped dessert which would have been a poor decision on my part. I asked my server what he suggest as i always do and he suggested the buttered mac 12 creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e as it was touched up with a mac 12 year scotch and had raisins soaked in burbon and with each bite i became more and more happy which my decision. After all was said and done this was not that expensive and i felt i got more than my moneys worth. I highly suggest this place to anyone looking to have a good meal at a good price.",1,2
"Great hotel  happy with the service. They had free shuttles running from the hotel to the strip/airport. The bedrooms were beautiful and customer service was great!",5,1
"A great place for cheap drinks and food.  2 burgers and 4 pints were only about 16 pounds.  The food was a bit above average pub fare and the beers were great.  Many guest taps were on offer; however  many were empty.    Big bonus: There were 2 TVs on the wall in the main that were playing soccer. Big bonus: There was no background music.  Con:  Tons and tons of people fit into this place (evidently it used to be an old bank)  and hence is super crowded and very noisy.  I was there on a Friday evening with a co-worker and we were very quickly served our burgers (order @ bar  served at table).",1,1
"I've had dinner here three times. The food is always delicious and the service is always outstanding.    Most recently I made my selections from the theatre menu and it was a great value for the money. I had the sea bass that is wrapped with potato.    The bread  you get as an appetizer  is awesome.  There are five or more choices and they're all great but my favorites are the pretzel and the bacon bread. Incredible!  Enjoy!",5,1
"This must be what gelato tastes like in Heaven. It was so good. White chocolate Nutella flavored  are you serious???",1,5
"Cute little place with some on street parking. Food was not amazing. I went with the grilled cheese because I think a place like this should have delicious standards and it's advertised as the best in Charlotte.  Dry and Luke warm  at least the cheese was somewhat melted but sheesh  I make better grilled cheese at home.  Fries were typical frozen bag type. The table ketchup had about 2 tablespoons left in it. As a past service person  that makes me crazy.",5,5
"GAT DAMN. This is some good pizza. So good that...  -I came here for a slice of pizza after I had eaten dinner at Earl's of Sandwiches and I was supposedly full. -I have made it a point to stay at the Cosmopolitan on my future Vegas trips because Secret Pizza only delivers if you're a guest at the Cosmopolitan.   Hard to find especially when the Cosmopolitan's own workers don't even know what Secret Pizza is. It's that secret  but I'll help you out because pizza this good should be enjoyed by the masses. Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. Find the lounge area with a pool table. Just off that lounge area is a dark  unmarked hallway lined with records on the hall. Follow this hallway to pizza heaven.",1,5
"Located in the Fashion Show Mall. This is an upscale steakhouse  and well worth the price. Everything here was great. It is not for a casual night out. So if you are in need of a place for a special night out  I recommend. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2,1
"Fabulous!!! Well it was fabulous for our purposes anyways. Hello affordable venue for a small gathering of oh lets say...a sizable group of people for a night. Check-in was a breeze. Plenty of parking. Security mans the elevators. Staff is friendly. Plenty of gaming and drinking options. Room is good sized and clean. Beds are comfy and you have all your usual amenities.",1,2
"My first review on Yelp goes to Bacchanal  because they are just that awesome all around in what they do contributing to the buffet scene in Vegas. :D  First off  the prices. Yes it is expensive for a buffet  especially if you come here for dinner ($50.99  $30 upgrade if you choose to do Buffet of Buffets)  but you are not going to regret spending that amount of money once you see the vast diversity of food they have to offer.   Second  the food. Nowhere else on the Strip can you find the vast quantity and quality of food that Bacchanal has to offer. I've been to many other buffets on the Strip  and none comes close to the titan of buffets that is Bacchanal. Some of the highlights:   -The seafood selection alone is worth the price of admission. From the fresh oysters on the shell  juicy king crab legs  succulent chilled jumbo shrimps (get it with their horseradish sauce!)  and even oyster shooters  it was something truly to behold and enjoy.  -The meat selection is pure heaven. The big ones: their brisket:  perfectly smoked  seasoned just right  and quite literally melts in your mouth. The prime rib was juicy and tender  and with the au jus  nothing comes closer in terms of buffet quality prime rib.  -Dessert: my goodness I didn't even know such desserts could exist under one buffet roof. The made to order crepes  selection of sorbet and gelato flavors  cr\u00e8me brulee  cheesecake pops  berry cobbler  and UNLIMITED MACARONS will certainly make your experience at Bacchanal a sweeeeeet one that you won't forget.  -Some other buffet standouts worth trying: wagyu beef sliders  lobster bisque  oxtail soup  lamb racks  sweet potato tater tots  and the fresh fruit drinks in glass bottles by the meat station.   Overall  if I were to have a last meal  it would definitely be at Bacchanal. I have no regrets putting down that much money for what I got  and will be coming back for as long as I come back to Vegas. Bacchanal  you have my heart and appetite for life. :)",2,5
"Delicious!!! I am not a hot dog fan  but the amazing combinations and toppings Buldogis has to offer has changed my mind. Not only that  their Kimchi Fries are a great side to share with somebody. I am never disappointed or still hungry after eating here!",1,1
"Went to the fair last week for a little bit before a concert on the grounds we had tickets to... Barenaked Ladies!!  More on that later.  Now about the fair... My bf and I managed to get into the fair for free with a donation of jeans and tennis shoes to St Vincent de Paul. Whoo!  More money for food.  ;-)  This is a pretty big spread of food  games  crafts and goods.  It has your usual fried food extravaganza  and some really crazy fried foods ... deep fried pickle with chocolate sauce?  Ick.  Chocolate covered bacon?  Pass.  Kettle corn  yes! Onion rings  yes! $12 beer  no!  Prices on food are a bit high.  A family of four could accidentally dip into their children's college fund if they spent more than an afternoon here.  There is a petting zoo for kids  and a ton of rides for all ages.  Beware: Go easy on the spinny rides if you have a belly full of fried fair food.   The concert started pretty much right on time; Barenaked Ladies were awesome! Very entertaining bunch of guys. I had purchased seats  but there seemed to be free general admission in certain areas.  Not sure if it has free general admission every night  but its worth a shot if you're interested.",4,5
"Yn has some fabulous features  but the price is high and it isn't always my first pick.  I wrestled between giving Yn a 3 or a 4.  I was really in between.  Read on...  I absolutely love the location.  It is easy to find and parking has never been a problem.  The ambiance is fabulous.  There is both an indoor and outdoor section.  The bathrooms are clean and modern looking.  Everything feels very sleek  however  the inside is a bit small.  It reminds me of a smaller Starbucks - a bar  a few tables  and some comfy chairs that can be hard to obtain if it is busy.  You need to be prepared to spend a decent amount of money here to spend the evening at Yn.  Wine by the glass is generally $8 or above and increase substantially.  On weekend nights  there is no entertainment (i.e. live band) and people do not mingle.  It would be a good first date scene but definitely not for a singles crowd.   I think you definitely need to try Yn if you are in the area or live near Charlotte.  However  I can't say that I return on a regular basis.  There just isn't anything that really draws me in.",5,5
"One of the best beer selections in Pittsburgh. They have pages and pages of bottles categorized by type but also listing descriptions  alc. content and brewery. The Imperial IPA (draft  great tap selection too) I had was Dorado from a brewery in San Diego that I've never seen offered here before. The bartender was really attentive and nice to talk to. You can buy six packs and get 20% off of any 4 bottles or more that you take home. Lots of seating but I really liked sitting at the bar due to ample space and clear sight lines to the fridge bottles (labeled by country)  taps and TVs. Also has an open window in the front.",4,5
"Gross  I should have just  made a turkey sandwhich at home. (How do u mess up a turkey sandwhich?) My sandwhich looks like it was smugled across the boarder in somebody's crotch. Do yourself a favor and have your sandwhich delivered by Jimmy Johns or Jason's deli.",1,1
"Better than the other burgers I'd tried in Vegas  pretty reasonable prices too.",1,1
"Like everyone and their mama  we come here for the bruschetta board and honey cucumber lemonade. We love all their different options but our favorite is the tomato jam w/ sheeps milk and the burrata bacon w/arugula and tomato. The tomato jam doesn't sound exciting or unique  but it really is! It's a must! My husband and I got turned on to the tomato jam by our server who recommended it  assuring us that we will not be disappointed. She was right  the first bite was so dangerous because we were hooked immediately! The taste is so addicting and the flavor is amazing! The burrata bacon is also amazing  you can't go wrong with bacon and it is everything you will hope for from a bacon bruschetta and more.  We love their happy hour $5 for a pitcher of hoegaarden! However  lately we have been skipping this amazing offer for their honey cucumber lemonade. It is perfect in sweetness  taste  and it is so refreshing!! It makes water incompetent for refreshment and it makes Gatorade look stupid.",4,5
"it was my first time here with my son and Family (Long time friends of the family) yesterday. We had a good Group about 10 and went here for a late lunch after having some of the group getting baptized at Central. Food was great  the Soups smelled as good as it looked (most of us did the Soup + Salad or half Sandwhich + soup/Salad. I had the BBLT + Ceaser salad  it was really good  bread was toasted salad was wonderful  my son ate his entire meal. toward the end of our visit right before our food came the Waitress did bring extra drinks and mentioned she was working that room alone  she was very polite  very helpful  great food  price is moderate so if your looking to spend a little then usual then I''d recommend going here.",4,2
"This place is a must. Their garlic Bloody Mary's are unparalleled. Their breakfast is amazing. You won't regret anything you order.",3,3
"Usually when you go to a salon and spa you get a section where hair is done and then a small section where the spa treatments are done.  Usually nothing special.  At XS you will notice a huge difference.  This place is huge and quite beautiful.  They have distinctly separate spa which are far from the hustle and bustle of the salon.  The salon itself is large and pretty with lots of stations and a pretty cool washing station.  Alex is the best  ask for her.  Yes  she is my friend and yes I am shamelessly plugging her but she is incredibly talented and loves what she does.  My hair looks fantastic when she is done with it.  She even gave me a tour of the entire facility  so that's how I know about the beautiful and extensive spa.  They also have a private courtyard that can be rented out for parties and etc.  If you are out in the east valley and want a high quality salon experience  you should definitely go here.  The prices are pretty decent for a high-end salon  especially considering the swanky digs.",4,4
"These guys do incredible work as you will quickly learn when you walk into the front office. Unfortunately all I needed was a new front door which they installed and it looks great. Maybe the next time I will have something more significant for them to work on. It was great to work with a small company and not feel like I was being taken advantage of.",3,1
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TIME OR ENERGY COMING HERE.  No.  Seriously.  Stop it.  Don't even think about it.    Okay  if you must  don't do any of the tours.  It's nothing you really can't figure out on your own and at least then it's free.  The triple-tour (the train  the mine tour and funhouse) were $18.  Buying two tours is $16 - so if you want to do all three it sounds like a good deal.    I know nothing about this area.  And I could have given a better tour than these toothless backwards and racist rednecks.  1) The train tour - took them about 5 minutes before they acknowledged I even wanted to buy a ticket.  I'm sorry - can you smell my feminist liberalism from NYC?  2) the train was cute but was not educational at all.  The guy was kind of an asshole and know it all by not telling you anything at all  then wanted tips.    3) The mine tour was not fun AT ALL.  The tour guide was terrible and an idiot.  My personal favorite was when he started to slam President Obama.  Look  I could give a shit what your political leanings are and you have every right to dislike the president.  But I could give a rat's ass what you think when you voted for Bush twice.  Moving right along  he says I'll move if he's re-elected.  Good luck in Mexico - you hate Mexicans!  And Canada is far more socially liberal.  Like I said  good luck but I guarantee in 2017  he'll still be there.  If he's still alive.  Asshole.  By the way  that's the only thing I retained on that stupid tour.  Not worth time  money or energy.  4) The mystery house was kind of cool  I guess  but again  the guy was a real dickweed.  Is there a dickweed gene in Phoenix that has yet to be identified?  Because there is a HUGE sample set  at least in the people I met.  5) Everything else was kind of nondescript.  If you have a lot of time to kill and you're in Phoenix  trust me...take the extra two hours total in round trip travel and go to Sedona for better pictures  vibes and jeep tours.  Don't do it.    PS I thought a ghost town would be eerier.  I didn't get that feeling at all.  It was kind of hokey and dumb.",4,3
"This place has some good sushi. Happen to see it driving back from the casino. I wish it was located in Phoenix.",5,5
"This was a great place to end the night.  Let me provide background: 6 of us girls went out to dinner (at Furio) for a lovely Girls' Night Out. After dinner  we wandered north down Scottsdale Rd looking for a place to sit  chat and get a drink (or two).   When we hit Italian Grotto  one of my friends said  Oh  this place has the best margaritas. It happens to be a favorite spot of her father's  and we peered in - it looked perfect.  They seated us enthusiastically  and the entire place was oozing NEW YORK. It was great. Our waiter was friendly  nosy  and flirtatious. Great for a group of married women out for a night. :-)  I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink. I told him I wanted vodka  but not a vodka tonic  but nothing too sweet .... He said  as he walked away  you're having a Mandarin Press.   Well  OK then.  Our drinks arrived  and I loved mine. Mandarin vodka with Sprite cut with club soda. It was fizzy and yummy and not too sweet.   A couple of the girls ordered an Appletini and the Cadillac Margarita (pretty strong drinks)  so when two of us polished off ours earlier  the waiter came back with replacements (another Mandarin Press for me and a Gin & Tonic for another girl) and told us they were on him.   The music they played was great - jazzy and classic. The bar had rows and rows of Yankee bobble-heads  and the 3 flat screens above the bar featured basketball and baseball.   I think we sort of closed the place down. It was 11:00 when we started to think about leaving  and the place was emptying.   It was exactly what we were looking for - a nice big round booth great for conversation. Perfect ambiance for the low-key end to our evening that we loved.   I would go back in a heartbeat.",2,2

"Just finished our dinner here and made this one of faves for taking out of town friends and family to.  We were warmly greeted by the host and seated immediately in the teppan grill room  which appears to seat about 60-70 at six different stations.  They call it a hibachi dinner.   If anyone has ever eaten at Benihana's or the Nijo Castle (Newark  CA)  I recall paying about $25-30 per Teppan entree.  Here  you pay $8.95 for the Hibachi basics: soup  salad  rice (steamed or fried) or fried noodles.  Then you choose your add ons or what they call mix or match which is your proteins.  Chicken teriyaki is $4.95  NY steak is $5.95  filet mignon is $7.55  shrimp $5.75 and so on   There is also salmon  $5.75 scallops ($7.55)   Lobster tail (6 oz.) for $15.95  Kobe beef $48.95.  They also offer 3 basic entree items (not included is the lobster tail  Kobe beef or Halibut) + the Hibachi basics for $28.95.   I ordered the scallops and chicken  the wife  steak and it is still cheaper than other similar restaurants.  The quality of the food is good. Portions were decent.  The soup was mild in flavor  the salad though was disappointing. The dressing was watery and you could tell the salads were pre-made earlier in the day.   Pre-tip for our family of four with 2 kid's hibachi entrees (steak & chicken) with sodas and  a large Sapporo was $76.  They do offer lunch. sushi  sashimi  nigiri  and a good selection of Japanese entrees in their regular dining room  which has a sushi bar.  We're hoping this restaurant stands the test of time and continues to flourish at its location since there is no other restaurant like this in the SW part of town   They also have a location in Pahrump.",4,5
"Went there 7/15/07.   Great food  nice setup.  We were there on a sunday night  ~9PM  and initially had the place nearly to ourselves.  By ~10:30PM it had filled up a bit  and we could tell the place is a definite late-night hangout.    Went to the original  main location.   Ordered the sushi dinner (~$30)  some dinner combo with a tuna tartar  shrimp tempura  terayaki chicken  a delicious rolled beef-with-scallions thing  and some salmon roll (~$34) and a spider roll (~$10).  sushi dinner was one each of salmon  tuna  whitefish  squid  egg  squid  surf clam  and a set of tuna rolls.  the dinner combo was HUGE  more than any one person could reasonably eat...   all the food was very good - on par with the better sushi restaurants I've had in Boston  NY  or Portland.  Spider roll was very good - well sized  and the crab flavor came through.  overall  we spent ~$100 on a very big (too much food) meal for two  at high quality (no liquor or beer).  Would definitely go again  but the sushi dinner and the combo and extra roll were about right for 3.",2,2
"ATTN: Kim T.  We'll I made it to Monte Carlo !! Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to the VIP check in due to the traffic coming from LA. ..  But not the less.

I would have to say the Monte Carlo to me has loss it's edge and forget the basics I would have to say that this might be the last time I visit any the the MGM resorts. It's sad to say.  I really had higher standards for Monte Carlo. Maybe not as high as your other properties but some what better. ...  We'll if you would.

"very good chicken for a fast food place. juicy meat in the chicken fingers and it tastes awesome dipped in the Cane's dipping sauce. I like that you get big pieces of actual chicken. I did not like the coleslaw  but I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general. the sweet tea is great - not TOO sweet like at most places. the worst thing about my meal was the fries. they serve the crinkly cut fries like you used to get with your cafeteria meal in elementary school. no flavor at all to the fries.   I'd definitely eat here again  but if given the choice between here and Chick-fil-a  I'd rather eat at Chick-fil-a because they use more flavor in the breading on their chicken and their waffle-cut fries are MUCH bettter than the fries here.",3,1
"I loved my stay at the MGM Grand!!! My husband and I were there from June 14-19 which was Friday-Wednesday. It was definitely enough time to see Vegas  and some of our group left on Monday or Tuesday due to their schedules and they had a great time in those few days! I had never been to Las Vegas before so I have no other Vegas experiences to compare it to  but it was amazing! I cannot wait to go back. My husband and I went to Vegas for his birthday celebration and I had been planning our trip for months. We heard great things about the MGM and decided it would be a great place for our entire group to stay (we had about 15 family members and friends flying in from all over the country). My parents stayed even longer than we did and they rented a car for the week  which was great. We took it to go off the strip for dinner a couple times and to visit Fremont Street (not the best place  I went during the day but heard it's more fun at night). There is also a Haufbrau (spelling?) House  a German beer/food place off the strip that my husband enjoyed going to! Here are the pros and cons of the MGM:  Pros: *Lots of restaurants - we went to Rainforest Cafe  The Pub  McDonalds  the place next to McDonalds that had Krispy Kreme donuts (yum)  the pizza place in the basement  the crepe place (delicious)  and Diego. *Great location - south end of the strip but not all the way down the strip  still close to NYNY  Walgreens  etc. *Close to the airport *Check in at the airport is available to skip the lines at hotel *Huge hotel  tons to do! *Good breakfast buffet  I went one time *Convenience store by elevators  has everything you need! *Elevators are fast (we used the ones behind a set of glass doors  go past the elevators in your wing on the ground level  they are even quicker and no lines!) *Pools are amazing!! 5 pools total  lazy river  and outdoor pool club *Clean rooms *Blackout shade in your room! Woo hoo! *Nice amenities in the room and bathroom *Huge casino *Cirque de Soilel show (Ka) that we has tickets to was right in the hotel  which was great! *Monorail is accessible from inside the hotel  which was awesome  Cons: *I was not treated nicely at Wet Republic (staff was incredibly rude to me) *There is practically no shade at the pools  get there super early if you want shade! *Lazy river was full of drunks  it was a little off-putting and felt like a cheap spring break in college *You have to walk A LOT! Huge hotel. *Long line to check out of hotel (we opted for the express check out) *Valet parking took over 35 minutes to get our car on the day we were leaving for the airport. We had called ahead  too  but it still took that long! That was unusual compared to the rest of the week  but it happened on the worst possible day when we needed the car! *Wi fi is horrible at the hotel *TV in two of our friends' rooms stopped working numerous times *The rooms smell pretty bad  not sure why *Sometimes the room had not been cleaned by the afternoon hours  but it is a big hotel so that is understandable  Two tips: Do not move anything in the mini fridge  they come to check daily to see if you opened something. Luckily they did not charge us even though we were curious about all of the items!  If you are traveling with four people and staying in one room  only book the room under two names instead of four. You can ask for four room keys and then you solve the problem of getting everyone into the pool (everyone needs a key)  while also saving money on the daily hotel charges for each person. I am not saying that we did this.... Just a tip.",1,1

"This place breaks your car so you have to go back to them! Theses people are crooks! I took my explorer in a few months ago for an oil change and was told my seals are bad and theres a problem with my air intake system and i should bring it back in on a later day  so i did and after 8hrs they said they couldn't figure out what was wrong and I needed to bring it back the next day for a specialist. On my way home that day my motor started to smoke  when i took it back for the specialist the next day I asked about the smoking and they replyed with we told you your seals are bad. After another full day with there specialist I was told the computer had gone bad and I now owed $800. 2 days later my breaks go out and are leaking.Now just a few days ago I take my 2nd vehicle in for in oil change and when i get it back they tell me my seals are bad and just today i find my breaks are leaking and going out. This place is full of crooks!!! Be warned",1,1
"You know what I love? Nice eyebrows. In this town trying to find an esthetician who knows what they are doing is like trying to find a good stylist in this town (meaning needle in a haystack). I went to Ken Vo's salon  3 other upscale salons  and was never happy with the results. They were always too far apart  too thin  not symmetrical and I could go on and on. I tried threading and my eyes watered like a baby because it was too painful for me no matter how good the result. So I said  look at reviews! So I stumbled upon this place and thought it can't be bad if the whole place specializes in waxing!  I showed up 15 minutes late because I got sidetracked  and the appointment in front of mine was already there. So the receptionist said I'd have to wait. I said  of course. It was my fault to begin with  so no problemo. I went down stairs  got a frappe  and waited 15 minutes. My esthetician came out and introduced herself and walked me into a very minimal and clean room (love that it was super clean). I laid down and we chatted a little  and she was very easy to talk to. I told her about my bad experiences before (Chola eyebrows included) and she laughed then started working on my 'brows. She was very quick  efficient  and it was probably one of the most painless waxes i've ever had. She gave me a mirror and ta-da! Eyebrows that matched  weren't too thin  and symmetrical. I was so happy! She asked me about my plans for the rest of the evening and it kind of felt like talking to a girlfriend. I was too impressed by how comfortable I was and her technique. I walked out paid my $16 and felt like I finally found what I have been looking for for 3 years in this town.  Wax in the City gives you great prices  friendly service  great technique and best of all  none of that uppity attitudes a lot of salons provide. Thanks to everyone there for a great experience. :)",4,1

"I wanted to write a review about Michelle and Rocio  who work at the front desk. They have to be commended for their phenomenal customer service because they are 2 of the best that I have experienced at almost any business. These two always greet you with a smile and by your name right when you walk into the place. They treat me like I'm family (Actually no  they treat me way better than my family). In any case  these two are excellent at what they do and they make the process go by seamlessly. I can say with great confidence that Michelle and Rocio will be in upper management one day. And I know that because they provide great customer service  they are proactive and take care of issues before you have to ask  and they always have a positive attitude. They are a vast difference from the bozo's that I normally experience in customer service. For anyone who goes in there next time  make sure to compliment Michelle/Rocio and write a nice yelp review (like me)!   Keep up the great work you 2!!!    -Arthur O.",5,4

Always rude service  this time my order was wrong n I called the first time and they said that I had the correct order and they no mistakes and put on hold for 10 min for the manager. I hung up and dialed again this time I sounded annoyed and got the manager quick. I was very disappointed more than usual.

"I have been shopping at the Record Room since it opened. This store is a very welcome addition to Scottsdale and provides a great alternative to the other shops in the east valley.   The prices are very reasonable  and I have seen some impressive collections sold in the store. They let store customers have first chance to buy the collectible stuff too  instead of going to eBay first like some stores in town. I mainly go for the used vinyl  but they also have new vinyl  CDs  DVDs  turntables  and even some music-related books and magazines for sale. If you are a record collector or a music fan  the Record Room is well worth a visit.",5,5
"Stayed here with my sister the night before she got married - and what a perfect place it was! Not only did they accommodate a super late check-in  they sent up chocolate covered strawberries when they heard my sis was getting married.  We stayed in an enormous suite (for about $400/night) complete with wrap around patio that was perfect for the bridal party to get ready in - all 10 of us! Pricey but worth it! While we didn't partake  the pool was pretty and looked like a ton of fun. It was a perfect beginning to my sister's wonderful wedding day!",5,2

I'm not sure what they put in their carne asada burritos here (probably crack  they are that good) but this location in particular has a different flavor than the others. Other menu items are good as well  but if you're going to this location do yourself a favor and get something with carne asada in it. As others have said... Don't bother phone ordering  just order when you get there to be sure you get exactly what you want. Bonus: open 24 hours!",5,1
"If you're looking for relaxation and more excitement than your regular hotel pool  Azure Pool at the Palazzo is the pool you've been looking for.  Here you can get a massage  dine on Wolfgang Puck designed cuisine or  have frozen grapes pool side.  The grape feeding was the highlight of my last trip to Azure.  We ordered it as a joke for the bachelor and actually got a lot of great pics and had some laughs!   The real draw of Azure is relaxation  this venue is very peaceful  not like some of the other Jersey Shore-Fist Pumping pool parties. You can't find a better place to kick back and relax with ice cold drinks  day beds  cabanas and they even have a saxophone player who is really talented that performs on the weekends.",2,1
"Not bad if you are looking for bargain products.  Some of the items have some flaw in it so you get what you pay for.  Okay location right next to Sprouts & Pet Smart in Old Town Scottsdale.",2,1
"Pizza is good. The pasta is fair. My husband and I eat here once a month. It's a bit pricey.  He gets the angel hair pasta but it definitely looks more like spaghetti noodles. Pasta isn't anything special. I like the BBQ chicken pizza or sandwiches. Service is decent",3,1
"Forgive this post. It's late  and I'm a bit rusty.   Last week  a coworker and I went to the Common Market for sandwiches. Hailing  most recently  from Chicago and  before that  Savannah  GA  I've experienced some awesome healthy-minded grocery stores. CM was right on par with some of my favorite markets elsewhere.   The food was great. I ordered the club sandwich  which was not only made awesome  but was also reasonably priced.   The shop itself  as previously stated  reminded me a lot of some of my other favorite markets of the same genre. And  being that I'm not quite the fan of Charlotte yet  it was nice to experience a place  in the city  that brought me back.  As for the staff  they were quick  friendly  and efficient. My only complaint was that I had to ask for a bag at the counter  to carry my lunch out.  Overall  I'd say CM is a place I'm glad I found in Charlotte. Personally  it brings back some good memories of places I've loved  and they have great sandwiches.   Fin.",1,1
"Hubby and I wanted one really GOOD meal in Vegas when we were there.  We also wanted a place we could walk to and since we stayed at the Signature  we first looked at all the MGM restaurants.  I suggested CraftSteak.  Even though I have a crush on Tom Collechio  I don't think that justifies $120 per person for dinner.  We liked the varied menu at Seablue more so we made a reservation.  I have to say  from the moment we walked in  the service was impeccable.  I don't know if that's a Michael Mina thing or an MGM thing but it is duly noted.  The decor and ambiance of Seablue really impressed us as well.  We sat against a beautiful aqua wall that was a fountain and it was quite serene and relaxing.  The dining room also wasn't too loud  which was impressive.  So they start you off with bread.  As noted in several reviews  this is delicious flatbread with three types of dips (hummus  egg plant  and feta spread).  Delicious...I didn't need an appetizer.  Also  they have a build your  own salad option  which I exercised (baby lettuce  beets  fresh bufala mozz  cherry tomatoes.  YUM!  Neither hubby or I are big fans of oysters so I can't tell you if they were good but they had many types to choose from.  We moved on to our own version of surf and turf.  I got the filet and hubby got the two pounds of king crab legs and we split them between the two of us...see?  We made our own surf and turf  isn't that great?  We're so smart.    We both had two glass of wine as well and the bill was $170 so not too terrible but definitely a splurge.  I recommend Seablue for a lovely dining experience.  The food is very good  the service is amazing and it's away from the ding ding ding of the slot machines.",5,3
"My husband and I went today and we greatly enjoyed the food we ordered. The portions were large  I could not eat all of mine. The service was good. We will go back again. I would have given it five stars except for the price. I felt the price was to high.",2,4
"I stayed here on July 30th.  Booked through Hotels.com for $22 which I considered a steal! When I arrived at the Hotel  there was a small $10.11 additional fee I wasn't told about but still felt I got a DEAL!!! The staff were all very polite  friendly and helpful.  There was a beautiful view from the balcony walkway that surrounds the parameter of the 3rd floor rooms.  The room was dated but not run down...just like Old Vegas...classy.  It was clean with coffee pot and other common amenities.  Nothing malfunctioned. The mattress was a little firm but not unbearable due to the luxurious bedding. It was hot as blazes and the a/c worked great. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely go back. TIP: Seniors get a 50% discount at the Cortez Caf\u00e9 but you have to ask for it.",5,5
"Tony is awesome. The best hair cut I have had here in the valley. I will be a regular. I am glad I found him  my hair is cut perfectly. He worked with me when I really had no idea what I wanted. He came up with a game plan  and I could not be happier. Had a beer while I was waiting and watched ESPN in a comfortable chair. I will be telling all my friends to go see Tony for their grooming needs.",3,3
"Newly renovated theaters with leather recliners and meals/kitchen coming. Been going here for about 2 years and have seen the transformation. We have gone because the prices are comparable  not very crowded and digital projection  and not far from the house. Now that the renovations are rolling I'm excited to see if when it's finished.",3,5
"The tapas here were full of flavor. Mussels were great  shrimp skewer eh  ok. The pork beef Fois GRAS was great... The best was the service and the sommelier Desi is really good. He's a level three som  which shows the knowledge and just follow his suggestions  trust me I'm a som  the wines are good.",1,2
"Golden Spoon is awesome; their menu changes all the time so you don't have the same run of the mill flavors every time you go. They have the usual toppings you see in frozen yogurt stores  and they have a punch card as well (every ten you buy you get one free). The prices are pretty decent- I just bought a quart for 4.99 on special this week. Sometimes the line can get very long  and you have to wait outside (the store front is very small  they only have two tables inside that sit two people comfortably).  My favorite flavors are Mounds Bar  and Cake Batter here. Their seasonal Pumpkin Pie is good.",2,5
"Dear everyone who is not in Vegas   Just landed here for the first time in my life to celebrate me and my boyfriends 21st birthdays!  Thought the airport would be a little more flashy but I love it here!  Sorry your not in Vegas!  Sincerely  Nicole",5,5
"I love me a bloody Steak! I love my meat to speak to me. what was that you said? ha!   This place is awesome  price you say? doesn't really matter when all that is on your mind is a great piece of steak. I can still taste it  mmmm....... Is there such a thing that steak melts in your mouth? well this one did.   I introduced my friend to oysters  she absolutely loved them. Has been hooked ever since  I'm not sure if you will find the same quality oysters everywhere but it is a safe bet to say these are quite delish!   This is definitely a spot that comes to mind when you say  VEGAS I hear  GALLAGHER'S.  I recommend sitting outside with the piano bar view. It is very entertaining.",2,2
"I have mixed feelings about this place. Some of the food is excellent; the soups  the salads  the ice cream  and it's a fun atmosphere for kids  but I wish it were a little cleaner  and sometimes the food isn't delivered as described on the menu  and it was a little weird to go to the checkout with my un-totaled tab to have the host ask me what I wanted to tip. Well  they hadn't given me a totaled tab at the table  or shown me the itemized receipt so I could a) check to see if it was correct  and b) calculate the tip.",2,3
"We ordered our wedding cake from them and it was beautiful. They did an awesome job I was truly amazed with how the cake turned out. it looked great and it tasted even better. We did a red velvet tier and two strawberry shortcake tiers. We receievd so many raving reviews about the cake. Everyone loved it. I was so happy there were leftovers.",4,1
"Delicious and friendly.  I like the low country boil.  After some experimentation we have found getting the crayfish and the sausage in the boil makes the flavors change pretty significantly.  The last time we got just the crab and it was not as tasty  got a pound of the crayfish to go and it was great.  We'll probably stick with the shrimp and crayfish boil as it seems to be the best for flavor and value.  The staff is always very friendly and accommodating.  Really sweet with kids too.  Bring your own crayons and the kids can draw on the butcher paper while they wait.",3,2
"Following the fro-yo craze  I realized I hadn't done my review yet for this place. We've passed by a few times but it was always so darn crowded  so the last time we were at Town Square  we actually tried it. It was really good. There were many flavors as well as options for toppings. It's well-stocked and the clean. The pricing was pretty good. For the both of us  it was under $8.00. I don't remember what I had because it was several weeks ago  but I remember loving it. It's like U-Swirl but on a smaller scale- smaller store. No seats available though  so we ate it outside against the wall  where passersby were looking at us (everyone always looks at our ice cream  no matter where we are  it never fails  everyone looks at us  wishing they had some too).",4,2
"my hang out spot. I love the people and the food. The coffee is excellent. The spot to hang out and do homework or catch up with a friend.",1,1
"The only reason I drove from the strip  all the way to this bar was because it was on Bar Rescue (I am addicted to this show)  otherwise I would not have known about this place. I went on Saturday night (1/4/14) at midnight and the place was not too crowded  but as soon as I walked in  I was greeted right away by a great looking female bartender (I wish I got her name). She was very nice and gave fantastic service. I ordered a couple of their Batch 19 Pre-prohibition recipe beer on tap. instead of being served in a regular beer mug  its served in one of those moonshine jars which i thought was pretty cool. I ordered the breakfast plate with eggs  bacon  toast  and hash browns. I was worried I wouldn't be able to order breakfast at 1am but the bartender told me it would be just fine :) I wanted to try that 60/40 burger  which is a 60% ground beef and 40% ground bacon hamburger patty  but I had been eating burgers my whole trip to Vegas and I couldn't go there again. I'll save that for next time! All though it wasn't very crowded  all the customers seemed nice. The place is mostly locals because its 9 miles from the strip  but they do get customers like me who go just because they wanna see the place in real life after seeing it on TV. One guy walked in and seemed visibly upset that the place wasn't poppin. I guess he expected more excitement and more people to be in this place  but the place was pretty quiet when I was there. They have a lot of nice TVs. I'd definitely come here for football if I was a local",5,4
"Great massage! Felt really relaxed after. Will be coming back for sure.  Excellent customer service.",5,2
"My favorite place to go in Scottsdale!   They are laid back and friendly.  The bar tenders and even the owner introduce themselves by name when you talk with them!  The music is very different every night so check the website or call first if there's something specific you're looking for. I just like that I can go to a place in Scottsdale and not have to worry about dress code  I can dance on their nice dance floor which is almost never overcrowded (totally awesome because I really like to move!)  the drink prices are about the same as anywhere but every so often the owner or one of the tenders has come up and bought me a round!  Or if I tip well they'll sometimes give me a free shot.  So they are totally friendly and nice there.   Good mix of live music and DJ depending on the night.  Over all I am very happy with this place  =)",5,5
"As always a very good experience  food was correct portion size and staff were as always very attentive. I have been back 3 times in the last 10 days as you know exactly what you are getting. Good food  service and ambiance at a reasonable cost.",2,1
"love the food and entertainment..nice to have a place in sun city here you can dance and relax. i have met a lot of nice people there. great staff!!!!",4,5
"I went in for the first time  found the the salon  through a fabulous Groupon deal $30 for a $120 value (cut  deep condition & blowout). The salon is very clean  modern & beautifully designed. The stylists are very friendly and knowledgeable. My stylist was Eric. He listened well and gave very good suggestions for my cut. I was especially pleased that he didn't yap and ask me alot of personal questions like some stylists do. Another thing I noticed was  Eric is very meticulous with his work. Even though I came in looking rather bummish  hair unmaintained for quite sometime using a coupon  Eric didn't do coupon work. He was very gracious and tactful. He did an excellent job and I will certainly return to his salon as a repeat customer. Very pleased with my cut and service.",4,3
"Came in for a late lunch on the hunt for some artisan pizza.  I found this place on yelp and other food blogs and have always heard great things  but I had to experience it myself.  On the first floor of the Plaza Hotel was Pop Up Pizza.  It looked very nice and bright  very clean and sheik  with great art work displayed on the walls  two tv's  great music and it was packed with people.  The first piece of pie that caught my eye was the Fremont because of the eggplant.  I loooove eggplant.  And the other piece I wanted to try was the Goodman which had potatoes as a topping  which was a something new for me.  And I also ordered a basket of garlic fries.  And to drink I was pleasantly surprised to find my all time favorite soda in the frige  Doc Brown's Cream Soda!!!  Hard to find  so I was shocked to see it here.  But this was a good sign that it was going to be a great meal.  The Fremont was fantastic.  The eggplant was baked just right  and very tasty and went great with the sausage and peppers.  The crust and bread had a perfect balance between soft and crunchy which completed it all.  The Goodman was great.  The potatoes were very flavorful and turned out to be a great topping on a pizza.  I would definitely have it again.  Garlic fries were hot and fresh  fries were nice and crispy.  And of course  the Doc Brown's Cream Soda was refreshingly solid as always.  Overall  it was great handmade gourmet pizza with reasonable prices  nice ambiance  good service  & Doc Brown's Cream Soda.  It's great quality food perfect for dinner  and fast enough for a quick lunch.  Definitely coming back.  This place could definitely become a regular stop.  I also put a name in for the Black Horse in front.  Hope I win!",3,4
"MGM GRAND is the worst place you can go in Vegas. We booked a trip for our anniversary. Arranged for time off of work (husband only gets 5 days a year  and we used 2 for this trip.) And we had to arrange for care for our 3 children. We made sure we had enough spending money to last for the 2 full days we were staying. On our 2nd day  we were going to w/draw money from our account for the day and found out we only had a balance of 30.00 dollars. We could not figure out what went wrong. We thought there is no way we spent all our money already in one day!! We had not even gambled much yet. We went to the front desk and told them we would have to check out a day early because we had no money left in our account and could not figure out why as we could not access our bank online with no computer. The dummy failed to inform us that they have computers w/ internet you can use. We barley made it home on our 30 bucks and were heartbroken that we did not get to finish our trip. When we arrived at home to check our account online  we found the reason our money was all gone was because MGM accidentally double charged us for the room AND the deposit (which was in case we wanted to charge anything to our room). They took our last 500.00 that was meant for our last day in Vegas. Completely their fault for charging us twice!!! We called as soon as we made that discovery and have now talked to a manager and someone from Corporate. Neither person cared or apologized. The first one said what's the big deal  we will refund you for the overcharge? And the 2nd person said it's your fault for not checking your bank statement before you checked out!. The nerve!!! No apologies. No refund. NOTHING. They accidentally took the rest of our money  which caused us to leave early  miss our anniversary dinner reservations and they don't even care.  Stay ANYWHERE but at the MGM.",1,1
"This place is so much fun! Indoor glow in the dark mini golf with a Kiss theme  yes please. My aunt had just been to Vegas and got a Bite Card so she gave it to me since I went two weeks later and one of the offers was 2 for 1 to Kiss mini golf. My friend and I weren't ready to drive home yet but we were over gambling so we decided to go. This place is kind of hard to find  its in a strip mall at paradise and harmon across from The Hard Rock. The entire staff really tries to make sure you are having fun just like they are. Some of the holes get kind of tricky but I did get 3 hole in ones. If you're in Vegas and trying to do something different this is defiantly it.",5,5
"Very upscale place with very few tables.  The service is great and the food is really good.  However I'd probably not go back to it.    The atmosphere is a little to quiet for my liking.  They are super high ceiling with no music.  It's almost as if you can hear a pin drop.  If you like that kind of place   this is for you but I tend to enjoy a place with some music.",4,5
"Small mom and pop joint in Chinatown LV.  Clean  newly remodeled and very popular among the locals so we gave it a whirl. We got the chicken and pork curry katsu. Deep fried fried flattened choice of pork and chicken that is smothered in their curry sauce (yum). You can choose either white or brown rice to accompany the dish  our fav is the brown. This is not your ordinary Indian or Chinese curry. It's a secret Japanese style that is usually cooked hours on end. I don't know how this recipe is prepared or how long it's cooked but it tasted really good. You can get it in a range of how spicy you like the dish from 1-10. The server didn't ask us and I totally forgot so I was a tad bit disappointed that the dish was not as spicy as I would like. Otherwise great find and a must if your in the area.",3,1
"WARNING: the pricing and business practices at this business are predatory and deceptive.  Although I was told at check in for upper respiratory infection that we take your insurance that DOES NOT apparently does mean that we are in your network.  That deceptive practice was repeated to me by the intake person  the office mgr  and now the billing department.  Meaning that if you want a $370 out of pocket bill for a 5 minute encounter with a PA (no MDs on duty) and an injection which may nit be covered then go here. If not -- please choose an honest urgent care business that does not charge hugely excessive fees and clearly informs patients of their insurance status before entering an exam room. Disgusting.",5,5
"We went there for breakfast on a Sunday morning at about 8:30. It was not busy at all. The service and atmosphere were really great. The restaurant is clean and inviting. My husband and I decided the coffee (very weak and funny tasting) was the deal breaker for us though. We won't go back  since the food was not too great either. My husband had the eggs bene and I had the special  banana and caramel french toast. the eggs were over done  and the caramel was really heavy and a kind of gross consistency. We very much wanted to love this place  since it's close to home and we don't have many brunch options near us. We'll stick to the Jet Room  I guess.",4,4
"Absolutely worst customer service possible And this came from the manager/owner of the place do yourself a favor and don't go here like many others have said.",3,3
"Very good  lots of different beers  good shoestring fries  Kobe burger was good",2,3
"Went for an early dinner so the place was not too busy  great food  great selection  great service  everything done fresh.",3,2
"Aria is try-hard.   The check-in guy made the worst small talk I've ever encountered. Utter dribble. Tried too hard to be friendly and came off super awkward and superficial.   The rooms try too hard to be modern.  There are several sets of buttons in the room that do different things depending on the state of the room. Totally not intuitive  guys. Try to be more like Apple and less like Microsoft with your design choices.  The rooms themselves are high-quality  clean  and look modern. If you're going for a sexy night  then it does the trick.  ATT signal quality was poor in my room on the 18th floor  such that it would take about 5-10 min to send/receive messages. So  if you're making a rendezvous  you might want to communicate from the lobby floor.  The supposed iPhone/iPod dock takes a proprietary connector that you must buy from the wet bar for ~$30. What a rip-off. So  bring a male-to-male audio cord that plugs into your headphone and into their line-in jack.  Also  I could hear a family through the adjoining door in the room  so perhaps they could also hear me  my gf  and our $30 iPhone music at midnight. Oh well. I paid $$$ for the room  I'm gonna use it.",5,5
"I don't know much about Texas BBQ  but I am from the Southeast and I do know a little something about BBQ in general.  I love Rudy's BBQ.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I haven't tried everything on the menu.  So far  the only thing I've had is the sausage sandwich  which I can't seem to get past  because it is so darn good.  My husband on the other hand  has tried several of their items and loves them all.  Besides  any place that serves sweet tea is alright on my list of places; I haven't had sweet tea this good since I left SC.  We currently live in East Chandler  not far from Joe's Real BBQ and I prefer Rudy's over them hands down.",1,1
"Came here on a snoozy Tues. afternoon. Happy hour is excellent. Waitress was courteous  and fairly attentive. I think on a busy weekend things could get behind.   Big plus was the prices were great for the quality and variety of food.  Best described as a munchies menu. Some entree items  but filled with tons of appetizers  all of which were good.   The atmosphere was nice  separate booth  with a decent bar selection and some tables.   Music was..all over the place- though not crazy loud until later around 6:00.   What bumps this up from a 3 star to 4 was the variety  quality and price point of food  as well as the privacy of booths.   Would recommend for small groups  casual meetings  and just dinner and drinks with friends. Decimates not a get in and out place  on the hand they don't rush you either.   I will most definitely return.",2,1
"I enjoy this sushi place  so I'm surprised to see the other reviews and ratings. The only unpleasant experience I've had here was because my mom and I were seated in a booth next to these obnoxiously loud females who I wanted to throw my food at. But they weren't worth my sushi.. my stomach is worth my sushi...",4,1
"Would certainly go back!!  We tried: Pork Tamales Chicken Enchiladas with Green Sauce Sopes with Carne Asada  I placed them in order of our preference.  The menu is huge  so we definitely still have much to try.  We went on a Monday early evening and we still had to wait for a table. This place does get packed. As we waited we asked those around us if they had been here before and all of them said yes and raved about it.  During our meal  Leticia walked the floor checking how everyone was doing. That was a nice touch.  All servers were attentive and prompt.",2,2
"They definitely need to work on customer service. I probably won't eat sushi for a year after dining here.",5,5
"This is the worst Roberto's I've been to. Terrible customer service!! They charge way to much to use my debit card!! C'mon 1.25 that's ridiculous I've heard of .50 then .95 cents extra for everything cheese bacon on a breakfast burrito C'mon seriously that ridiculous!! Then forget asking questions they couldn't answer it  looked at us like a deer in headlights and walked away to grab someone else that still couldn't understand and spoke good English just decided to ignore the question. The food portions are ridiculously small for what I paid. 4.00 for a breakfast burrito 3.90 for a carniasada burrito ended up totaled to 15. After all the dam fees!! Every other Roberto's I've been to I couldn't finish my meal it was so big these are like kids burritos! F this location",5,4
"Stopped by this place after my friends that I was with in Vegas wanted to go after seeing it on Diners Drive ins and Dives.  The funny thing was only one of us actually ordered a burger  but the ox tail chili fries  which were featured was really good.  Definitely a must.  I got the spicy chicken with some rice and onion rings.  The onion rings were amazing.  I could have easily have eaten another order  by myself.  Also a must.  The chicken was good as well.  It hit the spot for me that day.  My friends each ordered the buns  one with duck one with pork belly.   The burger looked good and my friend said that it was pretty good.  I also got a milk tea with boba.  They seemed to have merged with the Ramen place next door (which is how i was able to get some rice with my chicken) so there were items on the menu that were not something you would expect at a burger place.  We were there on a Friday at lunch time and we did wait for a bit.  There were quite a few people waiting in front of us for a weekday.  Once we were seated  service was great.",3,5
"We're being generous in giving 3 stars. The food quality relative to the prices would merit a 1.5 or 2  but we give extra for the friendly service. We recall dining here before and liking it a lot more before but we can't remember why. If your desperate for taco truck style you're in luck. However  just like there are differences between most trucks and GOOD trucks  this falls into the very average crowd.",5,5
"Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Fantastic ambience.  A bit pricey",5,5
"I went to Durango Lodge this past Saturday to go shoot some pool (they have three tables) and just hang out. I had driven past this place a gazillion times  but had never stopped in so we gave it a try. You really get the lodge feel when you walk in  lots of warm colors  wood and stone.  Had a great time  servers/bartenders were really nice and went out of their way to provide great service  crowd was mixed  old-young. I had heard on the weekend it sometimes could be a younger crowd  but that wasn't the case  we were only there from about 8-9:30pm.  Will definetly go back. . .",2,5
"I was in desperate need of a haircut  and thanks to yelp I stumbled across Ann's Salon. Upon walking in  I was pleasantly surprised by the lively music playing and the friendly staff that greeted me right away. I let them know I wanted a shampoo and cut  and they quickly assisted me.   The shampoo and wash was very relaxing and included a scalp massage  which immediately sent me into a state of complete relaxation. I let my hairdresser  Huy  know how I wanted my hair to be cut and he immediately started to work on my hair. Now  I have to let you know that my hair can be very difficult  but Huy took his time and paid a lot of attention to detail  making sure I liked the progression along the way. He even straightened my hair  which actually surprised me because I usually have to ask for that!   When he was done  I was completely happy and satisfied with the outcome of the haircut! I will definitely be returning again.",5,1
"Hands down my favorite place! My only complaints are that they over use mushrooms and it is a little pricey!  The Cajun Chicken Littles are off the hook and the cheesecake is awesome!  Love it!",3,4
"First bar experience  so it was alright. Wasn't expecting a whole lot.  Burgers are amazing though (a bit overpriced  but OMG their special mayonnaise is sooo good). The service isn't great - my friend got the wrong order and the waitress was like are you sure?.",2,1
"I've been going here every week or two since the highly convenient Neighborhood Walmart opened up in the same complex.  Boba is referred to as Bubble Tea where I'm from.  (Boba = Tapioca balls added to the drink; can be omitted.)  This place has been consistently excellent (quality  taste  pleasant service) every time I've gone.  Open until 8pm-ish.   Drinks take a couple of minutes each  so take a peek at the baked goods while it blends.  Previous day's donuts are discounted  and fully revitalized after being nuked for 15 seconds  but fresh in the morning are killer.   Blended Taro or iced Milk Tea are a good bet for beginners.  Local business worth supporting!",2,4
"Terribly disappointed. I should have known by the name of this place that I wasn't going to find a decent beer selection. Sure  the entire back wall is beer  but its just more of the same stuff you can find anywhere else.  The prices were the same as I've seen elsewhere  and there was no beer glassware to go with our purchases. We had to settle for brandy snifters.  If I'm in Las Vegas again looking for beer  I'll go to the Freakin Frog.",4,4
"Disappointing.  Don't waste your money here. It is nothing like the Olives in Boston. This is a pretty tacky place.  Poorly trained servers and cooks. The pork chop was so overcooked it was dry. I told the waitress and she had it redone. And guess what it was partially completely uncooked. definitely the two worse versions of pork chops I have ever been served ----and at the same restaurant.  The busboy was one of the least professional busboys I have ever encountered.  He would reach in front of you with a big water pitcher and almost clobber you with his arm whenever he serviced the table. It didn't help that we had to hear him sing to himself either. The restaurant obviously suffers from poorly trained staff  no quality control and a lack of good management.  Plenty of better places to spend $200.",1,1
"Amazing staff  quick service  and lots of tea combinations. Anything from milk teas to blended smoothies! Also delicious ramen is served here. If you are unsure what to order just talk with the staff and try will help you find the perfect drink to satisfy your tastebuds!",2,2
"Simply excellent. Fresh pasta  hardy well-seasoned sauces--this is everything you want from neighborhood Italian. Easily the best of its kind I've experienced in Vegas.",5,5
"We had the fried walleye (it's Friday) and the mixed grill.  It was a great way to share all the flavors if their dinner entrees.  Everything was great  mashed potatoes  fresh fruit  asparagus  and traditional coleslaw was all awesome choices for sides.  The wait staff was great and the owners were very pleasant.  If you're in Sun Prairie I'd say this is the place to stop and eat!",1,1
"I came here for New Years Eve with a group of friends. It was a great place to stay at especially with old-town Scottsdale being only 10 mins away with a cab ride. The service upfront when I arrived was welcoming and friendly and greeted us with a smile. That's something I like to always see when coming to a hotel for the first time. The room quality was nice. It was clean and ready once I opened the door. They had pretty good accessories like a mini fridge and a surround sound system with a nice flat screen TV. It was a very nice presentation. The bathroom and closet were in great shape and the bed was amazingly comfortable. They were 2 queen size beds that could knock you out instantly! Overall this place a was a great place to stay at and I would definitely come here again.",3,5
"I had a member of our household sprain their ankle on Friday afternoon.  While we kept the ankle iced and elevated  the pain and swelling did not subside Saturday evening.  What to do?  The 800 number on my insurance card does not have customer service who mans the phones in the evenings on the west coast or weekends.  I turn to Yelp to find the Urgent Care facilities in my area.  While FastMed was not my initial first choice. FastMed's website had everything I needed to confirm.  Their website showed my insurance was covered.  It also showed that they could handle a broken bone if needed.   My initial first choice who is part of my MD's medical group could not confirm this same information on their website.    We walk in on a Sunday a hour and a half after they opened.  We find one other party in the lobby.  The lobby was very clean  bright and the temperature was very cool.  After filling out the required paperwork  the young lady behind the counter brought us a ice pack for the injured ankle.  They were very prompt with initial meet with the doctor to x-rays to the diagnosis.  No break which was good news.  They recommended medical supplies from braces to crutches and where by no means pushy at all on us taking the recommend supplies for the injury.    I would tell my family  friends and fellow Yelpers to give FastMed a shot.  If your regular MD is not available.",5,4
"While Stephenie T. regards her comment It isn't funky  it isn't modern  it has no gimmick. Essentially  it's a room with a bar in  and like it or lump it. to be a crisitcism  I actually love this fact about Citizen Smith. Thats exactly what it is - a room and a bar. Oh and some seats that dont match at all but work beautifully as comforting your behind and describing the atmosphere in this bar - a bit odd and all over the place  but comfy and fun .Who knew chairs could tell you so much about a bar?  Theres also the live music - its jazzy  dont be suprised if you get some beatnik reading self penned poetry about the darkness of his childhood over a soft jazzy beat and some odd piano noises.  I love it.",2,2
"2 stars for the fat smelly man who is ALWAYS there inside when I'm there (and who I constantly end up walking past all night) 5 stars for the fabulous patio 4 stars for the crazy  cute Irishmen my girlfriend and I stupidly offered a ride back to their hotel  1 star for the crazy Irishmen who wouldn't get the fuck out of my car 5 stars for the time my girlfriend made a paper towel scarf in the bathroom and paraded around the patio all night  Average that up?  3.5  (Total guess...you do the math.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt and round to 4)",1,1

"Zumanity has Cirque du Soleil's usual extremely imaginative costuming and set design. . . . . Oh wait  were you expecting more?! . . . . Well  OK  here goes:  you would think that the combination of super-hot bods combined with freakish flexibility and strength would make for one *hell* of a sex show  and you couldn't be more wrong about Zumanity.  Somehow  the show came across lukewarm for me.  If you want sexiness or plain old (?) raunchiness  there are much better venues in Vegas.  So I've heard.  If you want displays of mind bending acrobatic  juggling and other circus skills  there are *MUCH* better venues in Vegas  two of them Cirque du Soleil's own:  Myste`re and O.

"Gro\u00dfes Pro dieses Hotels: die Lage.  Grassmarket  Royal Mile  Edinburgh Castle sind innerhalb von 5  die Princes Street innerhalb von ca. 10-15 Minuten zu Fu\u00df zu erreichen. Ein Sainsbury Local (ein kleiner Express-Supermarkt) ist nur ca 100-150m entfernt.  In der stylischen Lobby gibt es kostenfreies WLAN  das Hotel-eigene Restaurant bzw. die Bar lohnen sich eher nicht - gegen\u00fcber gibt es zwei Pubs  die beide besseres Essen in authentischerer Atmosph\u00e4re f\u00fcr weniger Geld bieten.  Das Personal war sehr freundilich und ist bei Bedarf mehrsprachig. Unser Zimmer war in Ordnung  einzig im Bad befand sich etwas Schimmel (mehr dazu unten bei Contra 2). Der versprochene castle view war allerdings nur erahnbar  wenn man sich ausreichend verrenkt hat.   Gro\u00dfes Contra 1: Die Lautst\u00e4rke. Weniger von draussen als viel mehr vom Flur und den Zimmernachbarn. Die W\u00e4nde bestehen scheinbar aus Papier und man h\u00f6rt wirklich alles (ja  leider alles!) was im Nachbarzimmer so vor sich geht. Hinzu kommt  dass die T\u00fcren konstruktionsbedingt von selbst zufallen - und das ziemlich laut. Besonders sch\u00f6n mit den d\u00fcnnen W\u00e4nden So wird man zwischen 22 und 3 Uhr immer mal wieder von vermeintlichen mittelschweren Erdbeben aus dem Schlaf gerissen.  Wir haben uns dann Ohrenst\u00f6psel besorgt - das erste Mal  dass ich die Teile ben\u00f6tigte um schlafen zu k\u00f6nnen.  Gro\u00dfes Contra 2: Die Luft. Das Hotel besteht aus einem alten Bau und einem modernen Anbau mit Glasfront. Hierzu muss ich sagen  dass dieses Problem scheinbar in den Zimmern im alten Teil des Hotels nicht besteht. Im neuen Teil allerdings lassen sich die Fenster aufgrund der stylischen Glasfront nicht \u00f6ffnen - Was dazu f\u00fchrt  dass die einzige Frischluft durch die schwachbr\u00fcstige und nicht regelbare Klimaanlage kommt. Besonders interressant wird das dann  wenn Morgens nacheinander 2 Personen duschen - Abends ist es dann im Zimmer immer noch warm-feucht und muffig. Dadurch  dass die Feuchtigkeit nicht anst\u00e4ndig abziehen konnte hat sich im Bad auch entsprechend Schimmel gebildet.   Abgesehen davon ist das Hotel eigentlich empfehlenswert. Meine Priorit\u00e4ten lagen hier eindeutig auf der Lage  daher war ich mit dem The Point zum bezahlten Preis eigentlich recht zufrieden.",4,3
"Wonderful burger. Had a Shroomie  the meat is great  the portabello mushrooms were fat and juicy. To my delight they had both the Cardinals and the Diamondbacks game on. They are waiting for their liquor license  so I'm excited to see their micro-brew selections.",3,3
"Not a bad place  but not a great place. I had fun  but I went there to dance and people watch so it met my needs. Definitely an interesting mix of people  while the crowd was 30-50 something for the most part. Don't bother dressing to the nines  or even the 6's. There were a few people dressed nicely  and in the country area you'll see some dressed in typical western wear. For the most part though  any (real) effort will be wasted. Though the people are nice and the crowd was fun  not a place I'd go to try and pick someone up or be picked up on.   Some of the highlights are: Definitely fun for people watching  especially in the 80's room. Also  if you're not a great dancer  chances are there will be someone on the floor worse than you. Plenty of people getting up to do the line dances  though it seems to be the same four or five songs over and over and over.....   The Bad: For the size (or maybe due to the size) the place felt empty despite it being Saturday. Kept waiting for a crowd to arrive or the place to get busier  but the crowd stayed the same from 9-1. It can work in your favor though  since that meant we could always find a table to sit and rest at when we needed a break. Also  they don't do blended drinks  which surprised me being a club that size.",2,3
"We've been staying at The Mirage for years after a bad experience with another high-end casino.  We are VIP's (which I think almost everyone is now-a-days) and we are treated like one.  It always makes us laugh to see the older folks who eat nothing but the freebies in the VIP Lounge.  We are VERY low maintenance and I know they appreciate that.  They pool is fabulous as well as the spa.  We always stay in either a Penthouse or one of the Villa's (we like the Villa as there are no loud teeny boppers slamming doors down there).  Jet is your typical nightclub...nightclubs were so much better 10 years ago  when people dressed in classy clothes!  Prices are very reasonable and the restaurants are great...especially Japonnais.",1,1
"Service blows here. Not sure if its because its late  but they only have 1 server for the entire restaurant. They don't have any pasta after 9p  the waiter asked what we wanted and we asked for a minute  he never came back! 10 min later I chased him down across the restaurant and ordered. He brought out our appetizer and after we finished  he passed by 3 times and a buser 2 times. No one came to pick up the plate. The main food took forever. It's ridiculous.",1,1

"My go-to place for thai food :) Although it's kinda far from my house  I still like to come here whenever I want thai food. I have tried green  red  and panang curry  pad thai  pad kee mao  pad see ew  tom yum kong  pineapple fried rice. All of them are amazingly good. The portion is pretty decent for the price too. Service is decent  the waiter/waitress always have a smile on their face  which is a good thing. Definitely worth a try :)",5,5
"My family of 8 had a great meal at Parma. We all loved what we ordered.  Chef Marc came by the table to talk about the menu. My dad absolutely loved talking to him. He ordered the veal chop and was in heaven. I had the chicken Marsala.  It was great. The kids mac and cheese was soooo good. And for dessert we actually had one of everything. My favorites were the tiramisu and the Kalua cake. When in Vegas we will visit again.",2,3
"Just got back from the Sunday jazz brunch  Every Sunday Brunch Buffet $20 per person Live jazz music  SCORE!  I thought the food was fantastic!

Love it.",5,5

"Came here after an exhausting 3 day festival in Vegas around 2 weeks ago  and this place hurt the bottom of our feets more than they did help. They were also very rude when we confronted them of their bad services and started yelling at us.    You don't mess with people from New York  Angel. We don't let things go  and you guys were the most horrible most disgusting people ever.",2,1
"a roundtrip cab ride will cost you more than a dozen donuts from here.  however  if you are a vegan (which i'm not)  then the taste of these vegan donuts would be worth the cab fare.  i tried a bite  and they do not taste vegan at all!    the couple working here is super sweet  too.",4,5
"I've only been here once  as I just moved to Scottsdale  but the low carb breakfast was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try more. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't tried most of their food. Definitely casual.",4,1

"I wasted  $62 on Joe's Tasteless Crabs. They use another adjective  but it implies how intoxicated one would                    have to be to hallucinate flavour for these crabs. Squeezing a lemon wedge on them saved them from nothingness. They came with a mustard sauce which obliterated the crab's lack of taste. Unlike this taste violation  their baked tomatoes with spinach puree and cheddar is a wonder to behold  and worth the long walk from the Excalibur. Even their tea was terrible. The service was surly and getting a towel to save my fingers from terminal crabbiness took some doing. I had walked by this restaurant a couple of years ago and thought they must do something wonderful with crabs to name their restaurant Joes Stone Crabs.. Maybe in Miami. Here it is all sauce  and sauceless crabs are tasteless crabs  and a waste of their lives and my dollars. Avoid the universe this restaurant is in.",1,1
"I've been to this new location a handful of times already. Everything was perfect each time. The owner is incredibly sweet and is very passionate and proud for his business. I live at Sunrise Mountain in North Vegas but it is well worth the trip. I do prefer the new location to the old location just because I enjoy the look of the new location better  and because it's right by Lakeshore. As I write this review  I plan on heading there for dinner tonight  and taking a friend to try it out!",4,1
"Literally my #1 good spot for Mexican that isn't too heavy.  Great margaritas and theres never a wait for seating.  Nice patio  bar  or dining room seating options.  Pros: Organic margarita Sonoran rolls Ultimate chimi Grilled fish tacos Requested hot sauce Friendly team service Great parking and location off 101 & Scottsdale rd  Cons: House chips not homemade House salsa is bland  prob not homemade  The hunny and I here keep coming back here each month to get the Sonoran rolls or grilled fish tacos- so yummy!  We made a date night a few times at blue agave and then picked up dessert from whole foods across the street . :)",1,1

"It's no Lenny's  but it is a good burger.  From time to time I stop in here when I need a good quick burger and the line at In and Out across the street is too long.

"I took pity on The Bellagio.  You see  I am the king of buffets around the country.  King R  the Inhaler.  I've closed more buffet lines than there are stars in the sky.  My photo is posted at most of the Chinese buffets around Chicago; they see me enter their restaurants  and they say  WE CLOSED.  GO AWAY.  Because I can eat some buffet  and if it's an all you can eat buffet  well...count your day's profit goodbye.  See me  and you better get on the phone to your wholesaler for next day's delivery.  And The Bellagio opened the next day because I didn't eat every damn morsel of food they have.  I witnessed and gently sampled their scrumptious array of fabulous food.  Heavy on seafood (the Bellagio is known for a large Asian gambling clientele)  two full display cases of beautiful desserts  and service that rivaled even some of the best restaurants I've eaten at (thank you Eljon!).  My only complaint  and thank you Paul A. who mentioned this  is that for a supposedly smoke-free restaurant  I smelled more nasty air blasting in from the casino than some of the other restaurants in casinos I visited.  For a place like the Bellagio  I was very surprised.  Alas  no star deductions for excess  errant carcinogens.  It's not the chef  waiter or food prep people's faults.  A piece of advice for those who complain about the long-ass line/wait queue: if you want to dine here  make sure you GO BEFORE 6pm.  I went just before 6pm on a weekday  and by 6:45  the line was insane.  But it's like that at most other buffets  so quit bitching.",4,4
"Regional Airport Awesomeness.",4,4
"Great burger place and good portions  definitely filled me up. I forget which burger I ate but I do remember the dipping sauce that they had on the side. It really complimented the burger  along with the big onion rings  it was a great meal.  On the plus side  they have a TV mounted on the wall with ESPN  Burgers a beer and ESPN  really can't go wrong with that combo.",5,5
"Hit Famous Dave's last night with the wife  a couple of the daughters  and a couple of their friends.  Even though we had a variety of people who would eat this  but not that. Everyone was able to find something they found interesting. Famous Dave's  especially for a large chain  is always solid.  The baby backs were a little scrawny but well smoked.  The brisket was similarly cut from a slab a bit smaller than I would use to smoke myself  but again tender and flavorful.  Even the smoked chicken salad and cedar plank salmon was well done. True there is better BBQ in town (Bootleggers  Black Mountain)  but Famous Dave's may be the best large BBQ chain in the country. Well worth it.",3,1
"This continues to be my favorite bar of all time!!!  And that's saying a lot since I'm half irish  half cherokee and all drinker.  The drinks here are super cheap  one vodka redbull  one black russian  and two buds ran me $20.  How great is that?  Even better  they had a punk rock elvis cover band.  Where else can you hear a punked out version of Suspicious Minds?  If I could I would move in here.",2,3
"in agreement with the prior reviews this is a great local pub with good food  good ales and a couple of decent wines by the glass. Although I have been here quite often  I had never done their quiz before until tonight (sunday) and I must say that it was pretty good.well paced and the right level of challenge.  Just a note-they stop serving bar food at 7or so  but if you want a fancier  later dinner  the new bell upstairs was well with it last time I went. Ineed to go again and review it!",3,1
"I was beyond impressed with this group of movers.  They were fast and efficient.  All of my items were wrapped in blankets then plastic wrapped as well.  I would use them again on my next move and suggest them to anyone else.  I found them on groupon but they actually had a better special going on through the company directly.",5,5
"Such a fun time!!! We had plans to go on Saturday (1/21) but damn that weather was crazy!  So we called and told it would be canceled so we rescheduled for Sunday.  We just couldn't wait any longer  haha.  The weather looked great on Sunday and we headed out to Boulder!  Once we got there  they were very welcoming and helpful it getting all the information filled out.  They go through a set of instructions before you even leave the building and have a mini zip line set up to show you exactly how to do it.  Simple enough!  One of my friends is afraid of heights so she was very very nervous but my mom and I  woo we were ready to go.  We got in the bus around 10am and headed up to the top!  As we are traveling to the top the guides explain a little about Boulder City and Bootleg Canyon  which was a cool thing.  They also have cheesy jokes but it does help with the nervousness!  Once we were at the top  took a hike to our first platform and WOW!  It looks like fun and once we got on  the nervous smiles at the beginning became  lets do it again smiles!  My friend who was afraid of heights  she was fully smiling at the end!  She was so happy she did it.  The guides were so nice and very helpful and made the experience even better.  They made sure they learned your names and talked to you in the down time.  We had a total of 9 people in our group and were done by 1pm.  I am sure if more people it would have taken longer because you have to wait for each group to get fully off the line before the next one can go.  But you can't beat the great views  smiles  weather  people  and overall experience!",5,1
"Went to have dinner Wednesday night.  It wasnt busy and we were seated right away.  We had the best server ever...Kristin!  Since it was my first time there  she explained how to order and made suggestions depending on what i liked.  She was attentive and checked up on us to make sure we were ok.  Oh yah  we were fine and happy with our crab!  The food was good and for sure I'll be back for more next time.  What I especially liked was how Kristin chased after us to return my friends daughter's ring and bracelet she had left on the table.  I thought that was cool.  Thanks Kristin...youre the best!",4,5
"When some people compare how awesome a city is  they would usually use its skyline for reference.  For me  I would have to use how awesome a cities Whole Foods is.  One of my sisters lives in Charlotte  and believe it or not  I like taking her son out and we go milf hunting at the mall and yup  you guessed it  Whole Foods.  Right across the street from South Park Mall  this place is hard to miss.  Let me rephrase that- it is hard to miss visually  but getting there can be a pain.  Yes  it sits on a busy corner.  And yes  it is right next to some construction.  And yes  the parking is kind of annoying.  There is a parking deck underground (don't worry  there are elevators for the carts)  and parking up top- but I found the spots up top to be narrow (and please don't question my parking ability  it is second to none).  Upon entering the building from below  you notice two long motorized walkways that bring you up (if you decided against the elevator)- as you go up  they have a cool fountain/garden thingy advertising the location (a first I have seen at WF)- there are plenty of pics posted to explain better than the way I just did.  I noticed too  this place is a decent size- one of the bigger ones I have been in.  Also  the eye candy was phenomenal- I must have ran into 5 shelves just oogling.    Another standout feature of this WF was the back right corner.  It had a cheese and wine tasting area in the back  and a second level where apparently they have all sorts of things that go on here  I think even including live music!  I mean  remember people  I am only talking about a market!  The hot food area looked vast too  and had a nice beer selection- enough of one for me to pick some shtuff out.  I tell you what  other than the dirty looks and the crap parking  this is definitely (to me) one of the better WF I have been in  and this is the stuff my sorry self lives for!",2,2
"I want to thank Yelp and all the Yelppers out there for helping me find this WONDERFUL sushi restaurant!  I was in Henderson on business and was looking for some good sushi when I saw that Ginza had some great reviews and they were not lying!  The fish was very fresh and the custom rolls are great (try the volcano roll!)  The staff also made this experience that much more wonderful.  Moonshine was very funny but also took the time to explain to me what part of the fish makes the best sushi.  I loved this place so much that I went twice while I was in town for only 3 days.  If you are looking for some great sushi in the Henderson area  look no further!",5,5
"The yelp photos look better than the dishes come out in real life... but make no mistake the food is good! The pancakes were delicious and I don't even eat pancakes. I think my favorite ones were the wild berry and the banana cream.   The corned beef hash was good but not great... the salmon cream cheese omelette had way too much cream cheese.. I think that dish or the fruit cup were my least favorite things.   Btw it's only 1 dollar to make your side of pancakes into the flavored pancakes so you should definitely take advantage of that.   Also  wow  the wait staff here... super attractive. Seriously. I'm coming back.",3,3
"Took my birthday dress here after a night at the club . ( let's just say I thought it was over for my dress ) . They had next day pick up   and my dress was brand new again ! The service was fast and friendly  I will be bringing my clothes here from now on .",2,5
"We came for breakfast as we were leaving Vegas and what a great end to a great trip. The eggs and hash were fantastic as we're the eggs Benedict my wife ordered. Portion size was generous but not out of control. The server  hostess  and bus were attentive and thoughtful. Presenting the check out server asked if we wanted coffee to go and double checked we had enough cream. A small thing but typical of the service we saw throughout our stay at the Cosmo.",5,5

"Penang.. Where have you been all my life? I was a Malaysian food virgin until i stumbled upon this place.   Delicious food  clean space  and friendly service.   Roti Canai - light crispy and doughy bread served with a side of curry                        dipping sauce with chicken and                         potatoes..FANTABULOUS!  Hainan Chicken - steamed delicate chicken that has a ginger soy                                  sauce.. with coconut jasmine rice.. delish  So many other things to try there.. but all have been great.  The best way to describe Malaysian food is a hybrid of Indian and Thai food.  For some reason my japanese palate and this cuisine get along real well.    I love desserts and they have some interesting ones.   Seek this place out.. it's incredible!",3,2

"We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key  fun  yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town.  Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable  sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard  a little better than just OK.  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp  me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!  we had such a fun time  the service was good  food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual  albeit fairly romantic meal.",5,3
"The Rio is really great for what you pay for.  I've stayed here multiple times  and will certainly be back.  BUT  I think they need to start checking the rooms to make sure everything works from time to time.  The desk lamp with charging station was inoperative (no light  no plugs worked); 3 out of 5 lamps in the room had bad bulbs; one lamp had a busted lamp switch; the curtain pull on both curtain and drapes was broken; tub took 20 minutes to drain after my shower.  That said  it's a room and you basically just sleep in it.  The casino is great  the pool area fabulous and restaurants are really great.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because of al the things in the room that didn't work.  So  the Casino  Pool and other amenities get 5 starts from me....but the actual room itself warrants 4 stars.  However  i WILL be going back there so don't let my complaints about the room send you away.  I really like the Rio.  Easy to get to  easy parking  shuttle to/from the strip.....I'l be back!  Oh  and you cant beat the price!",1,1
"A luring combination of ice creams  tray bakes and savoury snacks is enough to get me into most cafes. La Cerise offers such delights in a cheery mood and with decent degree of scrumptiousness.  They do a delicate apple and blueberry cake at around \u00a31 and combined with one of their strong black coffees is enough to lift your spirits for the day ahead.  La Cerise is an attractive cafe amidst a pretty dreary part of Leith  worth looking out for.",2,3
"This place should have a sign out front that says incredible lunch $13. Was here while on holiday in Montreal  the brisket was awesome and you have the choice of 2 sides  i had smoked beans and sweat potato fries  more food than i could eat.

"If you're staying in Vegas  or live here and are out on the town  forget everything you think you know about late night/early morning drunk breakfast. IHOP - haha  forget about it. Denny's - gross. Peppermill Lounge - perfect. When you walk in the lighting and decorations will make you happy  it's like an 80's night club with trees. Every member of the staff was friendly and patient. The food was perfect for the moment  yummy stuff. I got the Joes San Fran Special  which was filling and delicious. The prices are just right and the timing of the whole meal was on point. This should be the after after party spot for all club goers! Trust me   read my other reviews  I'm legit. ;) . Done",5,4
"Clearly built by North Koreans  this disgrace to American public transportation should be demolished and rebuilt because a) its not safe  b) its one of the most expensive transit systems in the country  and c) it goes nowhere.   I boarded the monorail only to watch a stroller wheel caught when the door closed. The monorail immediately started moving and half of us are trying to find the emergency button  while the other half is yanking the stroller wheel out of the door. We got it out just in time but really  seriously? What if that was someone's foot? Oh  and we couldn't find the emergency button either so there's no way to stop the monorail if something goes wrong. Praise the dear leader  he will clearly protect us...  The monorail puts BART to shame with its expensive ticket. At $5/ticket  I'm pretty sure this is the most expensive transit system in the country  on a per mile basis. $5....to go the equivalent of one or two city blocks? You must be joking...  To rub salt on the wound  this monorail goes nowhere. At first  you'll get excited because you'll see your hotel near one of the stops listed on the map. Don't be fooled. Apparently  a one mile walk is near one of the stations.   Don't even bother with this disgrace of a system. Either walk  or take a taxi. This thing goes nowhere  its not safe  and you'll pay an arm and a leg. Literally and figuratively.",2,2
"Now here is a new winner.  Great presentation and great food.  The noise level is a bit high  but I understand they have some fixes coming for that.  The menu is very extensive and original.  Service levels are high.  The technology on the bar (built in i-pad like devices) is very original -- and it works.  Eat your lunch while reading the newspaper beneath your plate. Or play a game while waiting for the food. Decor  and the entire concept are fresh  and to top it off  they have their own shuttle bus from the mall to the out-parcel where they are located.   Parking was open very close to the restaurant the day I had lunch there. So that was a plus over competing places as well.",2,4
"Excellent stop in Downtown Summerlin. The food and ambience was phenomenal. Had the Lemon garlic wings. Came out piping hot and delicious. The happy hour specials were a great deal too. Will come back",5,5
"Not sure if this place is worth the 3 hour wait.  The lines will probably die down once the buffet isn't as new any more.  But once you get in  you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of food options to choose from.  It's like the Buffet @ Wynn or Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo but 2-3x larger.  There's Asian  Mexican  Meats (American?)   and Seafood sections to cater to everyone's needs.  In addition  there's freshly squeezed oj  cucumber  and tropical (mango  pineapple) juice near the seafood section which is near the front.",3,3
"Lured in by one of her clients 4 years ago we are forever hooked on Olga's services.  Her professionalism and kindness are unparalleled.  She has no equal in my opinion. If you are seeking an aesthetic enhancement book an appointment now... but don't steal my slot :)",3,1
"The good:   -I love their shirts.  I'm 6 ft 185 and size L fits me perfectly.  I am usually right between M and L so it can be tough. Great designs and material as well. -Price is right  and they always have sales -You get $ back for every purchase -Service seems good when you call or email they do respond.  The bad: -My first purchase took forever to ship  like over a month.  and finally they told me it was out of stock.  Only store credit  no refund. -They have had site issues where it was impossible to skip your crate  now fixed though -I bought a sport coat from them in my normal size  41.  Great material  but the sizing is absolutely ABSURD.  I don't know why I didn't return it  dumb move.  The arm holes are sized to fit an emaciated manchild.  My arms barely squeeze into them and it's just about impossible to wear.  The coats are also really short  they look funny. They're so cheap and nice designs that I want to try another one in a few sizes up though.",4,5
"I love MOTO. I Crave their Curry Soup. It is amazing. And their Moto Chicken Salad has been a favorite of mine since back in their Shogun Express days. I am so glad I found it again. I've taken out the large and it fed my daughter and I for 2 days. I try to hit MOTO whenever I am even close to that part of town!!!",5,5
"Totally disappointing.  Go to Mon Ami Gabi on the other side of the casino floor if you want french bistro type of food.  The savory crepe I had here was dry and tasteless  while the one at Mon Ami Gabi was excellent.  Service was a bummer too.  Our waiter was inattentive and grumpy.",3,1
"Update: This time around I wasn't too impressed. Service was bit slow though it didn't seem that busy. My skinny lemonade tasted like a sugar cane with a drop of alcohol. The queso fundido wasn't as good as I remember and I had the beef brisket taquitos which weren't much to rave about either.",1,5
"This small boutique is a family owned business. The store is really two separate stores in one. There is one store that has jams  candies  oranges  grapefruit  in the Summer  peaches and tomatoes. There is an ice cream stand too.   The gift store has things you will find nowhere else. It is the holiday season and it is beautifully decorated for Christmas with trees everywhere. You have to scope out the store and take a second lap to be sure you did not miss something. I never leave without buying something.   Don't miss this jewel. You will love it!!",4,5
"3 stars for an average sushi experience:   Wait time was 30 minutes  which isn't terrible considering some places have an hour wait for a Friday night. The service was okay  nothing to rave about  but they weren't terrible. Not very personable or helpful. The food was meh  it's not the best  but there's definitely worse out there. I think I'll stick to Yama sushi",2,1
"Decided to go here one Friday morning after hearing the hype. The restaurant was mildly busy  about 5 other families. The hostess was pleasant as was our waitress. The restaurant d\u00e9cor was cute with its vintage feel. I also enjoyed the fun 50's music playing!   I rated this so poorly due to a few things... First off  we wanted orange juice but quickly noticed it was... $6.00 a glass!!! Now  if this were Phoenix or Scottsdale  I could understand the price! I could also understand the price if it were AMAZING and made from exotic oranges. Sadly  it was neither. My husband ordered the ham combo and it tasted great. I ordered the waffles with strawberries and cream. Sounded delicious  tasted mediocre and was $8.00!!!!!!! The waffle was the size of a small 6inch plate and had maybe 4 strawberry slices and 2 small scoops of whipped topping. The quality was far from $8.00 worthy! I've had better waffles at IHOP! In also want to mention  the waitress really pushed the large Wolfpack combo. Now there is one for $8.50  but that was not the one she was pushing  it was the $16.00 one!! She recommend it like  4-5 times. We thought that was odd and maybe just our waitress  but when watching the other's  they all pushed it. Which made not only us  but several other customers uncomfortable. We actually had a conversation with the people at the table next to us about it. They too were shocked at the inconsistency of the pricing and the quality of the food.   Needless to say  we will not be back. We would rather visit IHOP  Crackers & Co  or Wildberries.",5,5
"Best food ever!!!!!!!!!!!",4,2
"This place is just around the corner from where we live and we're on the hunt for a favorite neighborhood Chinese food place so this was first on the list. My boyfriend went to pick up the food and let me just say...it was ridiculously fast. I don't think he could have gotten McDonald's drive-thru that quickly! Not that promptness it a bad thing  but it did make me questions the whole made fresh to order scenario. We ordered Sesame Chicken that came with white rice and then General Tso's that we substituted fried rice. For $2  it was just rice that was swirled in a pan with some oil I think  there was no vegetables  no real flavor and negligible amounts of egg  so not really worth the substitution. The chicken was good  a little dry  but good flavor. They do serve nice recognizable pieces of chicken  as opposed to the super heavily battered  fatty  greasy  could be stray cat for all you know pieces of chicken. The chicken was lean and the sauces were not oily at all  as Chinese food goes.  The General Tso's was not very spicy at all unless you got a piece of one of the peppers  but still had that General Tso's flavor. The sesame chicken had that nice nutty rich flavor to it. Overall it was pretty good. I had originally selected 3 stars based on pure food quality  but based on speed  price and their lunch specials are super reasonably priced  can't wait to try those  I bumped it up to 4 stars. Mr. Chao's Asia Bistro and Great Wok are the next contenders on the list  so we'll see who comes out a winner!",4,5
"I have been to this location many times. I usually eat lunch from the lunch specials. I find the service quick and friendly. They usually can get you in and out in 30min. The service is friendly from the greeting Neil the exit.",2,2
"Fear not  Black Dog totally lives up to the hype. I WISH there was a barbecue place in Chicago that even compared.   I'm not one for moderation  so whenever I'm here I have to get everything that I really like. Which is a lot: Chicken wings  pulled pork  hot Georgia peach sauce  twice baked potato casserole  sweet potato fries  beans  and cornbread. I also like to get a flight of all of the sauces because even though the hot Georgia peach is pretty much one of the best things I have ever eaten  I like to dip my hunks of pork in all of the different flavors. Oh  and they have an awesome selection of craft beers and cocktails.   One time I came here and ate so much that I couldn't eat anything else for 24 hours.",4,1
"To all my CHAIN HATERS out there....DON'T READ MY REVIEW! OK....I'm one of those Chain haters so sue me. BUT! I've got to tell you that THIS chain is A-OK! Why? Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why!  You know  upon thinking about it  you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a chain is because they have a pretty good product to being with  right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes  I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs  Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger  you WIN!  Had their Big Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very BEEFY meaning  plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast  right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless  it really was great!  Oh  their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy  and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great!  Overall a 4.37 STAR experience! I just wish that they'd offer a Double Burger for us true Meat-a-tarians!",4,5
"I just paid $14 for peas.    I guess I was expecting something magical about the English peas but they looked like regular old green giant to me.  I like peas.  So when the gentleman behind the bar described them as phenomenal  I was all in.  Phenomenal was kind of a reach but with the pancetta and fennel mixed in  they were tasty.  I like this place.  I stopped in for dinner at the bar and it was definitely the most entertaining seat in the house.  I never knew that people slammed martinis like teenagers on spring break but apparently they do.  Seems like it would be much more efficient to just buy a handle of Skol.  But I digress.  I started out with a Rockin' Rye  which is a pre mixed house concoction of rye  rum  aromatics & herbs served with one giant ice cube.  It's kind of fun that they have it up lit in a glass decanter on the bar.  It's a pretty good cocktail.  For dinner I ordered the loup de mer  which is prepared mesquite grilled with a little olive oil...and the peas.  I'm really glad that I didn't order a potato since the chef surprised me with a complimentary round of duck fat fries in three flavors.  Wow  those fries are good.  Old bay  herb  and truffle seasoned with specialty sauces.  All were delicious.  All in all  the food here is fantastic.  This dinner was great but I still have memories of the amazing kobe burger I had last time.  So good!  I won't hesitate to come back for more.",5,5
"Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay... Camp Bow Wow is in the motha fuck'n house!   Whenever I go to Vegas with my dogs and I plan to gamble like I have no reason to lose or I know I'm going to go HAM up in the day club I sign them up for doggy day care. Its just the responsible pre-drunk thing to do. They get to play with doggies their size and if you bring your own food they feed them. It tires them out and saves you from them tearing your whole shit up at the hotel room.  The staff are friendly  the prices are reasonable  they have both half and full day  day care. I took off a star because there is no 24 hr staff on premises for over night boarding. Ah well  you can't have everything.  Oh yah! They have an app so you can watch them anywhere you go over your phone. So sick!",2,1
"Great job done and the doggie tie and the squeeze toy was a bonus.  Very courteous staff and high level of service.  Extremely reasonable prices and Alex was the most gracious and flexible in terms of appt and pick-up time.",1,1
"I've had both the thin crust and deep dish pizza here. Both were really good  but different.  The thin crust came in a bag  was cut into squares and stunk to high heaven! That's not a bad thing!   It was topped with grated cheeses that took me back to flavors I haven't tasted in 30+ years. That said it is strong and if you're smell sensitive this may not be for you. The sauce was a bit more tomato pasty and a bit heavily basiled for my taste  but it won't stop me from having another one.  The deep dish has a nice cornmeal crust filled to the brim with toppings. Mine were not as evenly distributed as I would like. Almost half sausage  half cheese. The sauce is the same a the thin  but more. The crust was very tasty  however the inside of mine was mushy - which took away from some of the enjoyment. Maybe the crust needs cooked a bit before the ingredients are added?  The ceasar salad was good  I wish they offered a chicken ceasar.  I will definetely need to try this out again. Really good place for a change of pace.",1,1
"My new A/C guy.  He is KNOWLEDGEABLE.  That is HUGE. All the other HVAC companies you call cannot give you the correct time of day.

"Pooley's has partnered with a new restaurant and the food is AMAZING! I was skeptical to return there after a bad experience with the old restaurant owner and the food has improved 150%... I will definitely be going back for nachos and the Italian beef and enjoy myself a Capitol Seasonal!",2,1
"So a couple girlfriends of mine took me here last night (I know  why were we partying on a Tuesday?) and I fell in love with this place!   Shots are not in shot glasses; they're in 8oz glasses... so  get ready to be more inebriated than you had planned ;)  There were two female bartenders - both were so full of energy and adorable. Katie was our bartender and hands down  best one ever.   It was a Tuesday night  but regardless  the place got packed. I have to check it out on a weekend!",2,2
"I had such a great time at this Yelp event. If you weren't already in the Christmas spirt  it's time to break out the ugly Christmas sweater and stop procrastinating! I love how creative everyone got with their sweaters- the Grinch one was pretty sweet. We also got to take pictures with Santa and he was the jolliest Santa I've met during my adulthood. He really made me consider if I had been naughty or nice this year. I'm glad he saw the angel halo above my head because I was good this year!  Now  about The Corner - this place is so cute. It's tucked away in downtown Phoenix Cityscape right next to the ice skating rink  we even got coupons to go skating. We tried a sampling of gourmet salads  cheese and charcuterie  homemade hummus muddled wine  cranberry mojitos  and topped it off with a cookie decorating station. Super fun!   That's not even the best part. We had the most epic exchange of white elephant gifts that I've ever seen. There were over 50 participants with an incredible range of gift ideas. Have you ever received a shake weight? You probably want to. It was a big hit as a white elephant gift. If you're tired of looking at your old bowling trophy- why not gift it to the white elephant gift exchange? Somebody did! Haha not many steals on that one!   The white elephant gift exchange was really fun and I'm glad it was part of the event. Thanks for getting all the Yelpers together for a holiday party we'll never forget. Merry Christmas everybody!",2,4
"Thanks  great deals! Great customer service!",4,5
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  Eva's zumba classes are the best!  I don't even feel I'm working out for a full hour!  It definitely hits me after the hour is over when I find myself trying to catch my breath and drenched in sweat :)  It's seriously a dance party everytime I come here for a zumba session!  Out of all the cities and different zumba instructors I've tried  Eva is  by far  the best one!  Her energy is so out there and she really encourages everyone to just keep moving!!!    The studio is huge and accommodates a lot of people!  One of the times I went in for a zumba session  I counted over 70 people!  And it didn't feel crowded at all... that's how big the studio is!  I would recommend anyone who wants to dance up front by the stage to come early.  But really  wherever you are in the studio  you'll be able to see the stage up front.  The monitors also help if you're all the way in the back.  I highly recommend this place.  Not only do they offer zumba  but they also offer kickboxing and powerflow.  I can only comment on eva's zumba classes  but I'm sure all the other instructors and the other classes are awesome as well.  I can't wait to try everything else!",1,1
"I figure since I go here almost daily during the work week  I should probably give it a review. And  you have to figure since I go here pretty much daily during the work week that I really don't have any major complaints.   I've been really trying to make a conscience effort to be healthier  and I know that I've been cramming my face with some not so healthy  but delicious options during my weekends  I still try to stick to a grilled chicken sandwich with no mayo for lunch.   Now  I've had grilled chicken sandwiches before and none of them really tickled my taste buds. The first time I drove up to the drive thru during my lunch hour  I told the lady on the speaker (which is horrible by the way.. more on that in a sec.) that I needed a few minutes. I pondered over the ever delicious Bo Berry Biscuits  and the seemingly bland option of the grilled chicken sandwich.   Well  I've been doing Insanity  and I could hear Shaun T yelling at me from my computer at home  and that's a bit of distance to hear a big muscle man yelling at you! So I opted for the grilled chicken instead with a pouty face as I drove back to work.   I get back here and open up my sandwich and take that first bite... WOW!! YUM! This is the best grilled chicken sandwich I've ever had  and it's right around my calorie mark for a meal for Insanity. Perfect!   The speaker system sounds very echoish  and it's hard to hear them sometimes  but if that's my only complaint  then I'm good to go.",1,1
"I'm a yelp FAN-atic and I usually expect the best experience when I'm trying out a yelp reviewed established that has earned a good amount of great reviews. Ok  maybe in this case four reviews was really taking a chance on a new place but I was brave.   I live in South Chandler  work in Phoenix  and tend to have most of my fun in CenPho. Honestly I love that downtown has neighborhoods with character  unique shops  and trendy hold up on their own restaurants to boot! Anywho  I went to Moira last night with some expectations  mainly a place for good sushi (to satisfy my sushi craving this week)  enjoy a martini or two  and to have an amazing experience (well  amazing has only happened once  and that was FEZ).   I went with three other friends  two of whom are sushi lovers and another that enjoys three things at sushi joints and that is  veggie tempura  a california roll or something like that  and an eel roll of sorts. Anywho  from the outside  Moira it looked cool  very urban chic on a quiet street. The hostess was really nice and the layout was how it was described in the other reviews  very modern with the whole urban feel. I don't know but the bar area reminded me like a pei wei setup  and the whole leaning buddha frames seemed out of place.   With the ambience in place  I was looking forward to my sushi experience  so we waited at our table  and waited a few more  and waited... to the point of after 15 minutes of not getting any waters or seeing any sign of a server coming up to us  my antsy friends were asking me if I knew any other sushi place we could go to in the area. Oh maybe I should note the time we first sat down  it was 7:25PM. And the restaurant was somewhat busy  a large number of tables were filled  and it was really cold.   Finally we were served water of which our server asked out drink orders and appetizers. We got ourselves an order of the calamari and the veggie tempura. then we waited... I have to admit we got our drink orders quite quick  I'd say 15 mins tops followed with our apps. The calamari in my opinion tasted interesting. My friend  S. described it as tasting like kung pao sauce with calamari it was sweet  yet had a little spice with red peppers  some mushrooms  onions. It's not a calamari that I would want to try again but it wasn't bad either. The veggie tempura was basic  some baby corn  yam  the usual in tempura batter  nothing special nothing unique. So let's talk about sushi.   S. and I shared three rolls  they were the spicy yellowftail  the jade  and the zu. D. had the geisha and the eel cucumber. We were hungry and after eating our mediocre apps  we waited and waited  ok let's say service was slooooowwwwwww and when you have slow service and hungry sushi craving people  tempers flare and what was supposed to be a great dining experience suddenly becomes a bad one.   When your server drops off hamachi yellowtail sashimi on the house because of the long wait  you know service is slow  and when you are told I'm sorry for the wait but we only have two sushi chefs in the back and alot of orders you know it's poor prep  and therefore slow service.   The hamachi sashimi was good but who serves sashimi without wasabi and sushi without wasabi and ginger? Apparently Moira does. And honestly why would I the customer have to ask a server at a sushi place for wasabi and ginger  I would think that's a basic requirement. So we waited close to 25 odd minutes for my friend D's rolls which were the geisha and the eel cucumber... 10mins later came our first roll the Jade  10mins later the Zu.... and then my friend A. who ordered Sashimi and Negari  her oder came in 15 mins after. As you can see our orders didn't even come close to each other  so instead of us enjoying our meal together  it was like watching one person eat while the others waited. We finally got our last roll  the spicy yellowtail 20 mins after A.'s order. And got our check at 9:10PM. I enjoy a leisurely dinner when I'm out with friends but something I choose to have and not because a restaurant's poor service is forcing me to have a loooong dinner.   Alright sushi not phenonmenol sushi accompanied by a slow inattentive service made my night out at Moira not that great. Servers should attempt to check on their customers every so often  I feel that they seemed shorthanded given it was a Wed. evening but still that is no excuse for slow service. I don't believe I'll come back to Moira again. I just felt shortchanged that something with promise could have turned out for the best but in this instance it marred my sushi night out. it's a thumbs down for Moira.",5,4
"My girlfriend and I treated ourselves to the 2pm tea and had such a lovely time.  The service was very friendly but is not fast.  The whole experience should be Savored and not rushed so I'd attend with someone you enjoy talking to!  The food was excellent and we tried 5 different teas in total.  We had a crazy time parking due to an event at the hotel but the server was so kind about it and gave us some tea to take home for our trouble.  I thought this was above & beyond and was surprised by the gesture.  I'd recommend it and would love to go again soon!",3,3
"Excellent service; authentic Turkish food; wonderful ambiance and very friendly atmosphere; very reasonably priced; real value",5,3
"Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!",4,2
"My parents were stopping through town on their way home to Tucson and we decided we wanted sushi. I used good 'ol Yelp to help us out and found this place.  Very good. The sushi tasted fresh with just the right amount of sauce.  My dad got a yakisoba dish and it was also very good. The veggies were so fresh and had a little crunch to them. I will be having some great leftovers. I take off 1 star only because their sushi selection seems a little short. I did notice they had some specials on the board  but I would have loved a longer list.",1,1
"Balanced selection of shoes  jewelry  clothes & handbags. Thoroughly enjoyed the vibe of the place & the sales staff were so kind. I just love me some Kate Spade!",2,3
"Pho Kim Long is the best Pho in vegas!!!!",3,3
"Great time here this past summer. Great service by Bex  she made sure everyone in my group had a great time. Very crowded but what do you expect! If you come here make sure you look for Bex  she'll hook it up.",1,1

"I really like the location of Pleasant View - just on the west side of Madison  it's quick to get to.  The course itself is very nice.  I like the variety of the holes and it's always in pretty good shape.  Prairie:  The Prairie nine is probably the course I've played the most.  I like how it has thee par 3's  3 4's and 3 5's.  That's different  but still adds up.  The holes have character  and if you're a long hitter  the par 5's are a chance to help your score.  Woods:  The Woods nine is probably the most scenic.  Obviously  you'll encounter some trees.  Again  holes with character.  Bring your bug spray in the summer!  Lake:  The Lake nine is my least favorite of the three  but it's still decent.  There is some water on the hole  but it's named because you can see Lake Mendota from the hill it's on.    The clubhouse is very nice - good food and a great patio to sit on after a round and enjoy a cold one.  The staff there are always very nice.  If you watch sites like golfnow.com you can find some great deals throughout the year.  I think Bucky Book and/or Entertainment Book have BOGO coupons  but watch for when they're applicable!  This is a very nice course that is great for all levels of play.",4,2
"Good little breakfast place.  Simple and rustic.",1,5
"Been doing chiro for decades.  Dr Armstrong is attentive and genuine.  I was concerned that the joint was going to be a low cost  and low service  experience.  No bells and whistles here  but top notch customer service and patient care.  Highly recommended... Don't pay crazy prices for what you don't need.",4,3
"We went to Burger Bar for a late afternoon snack. The kids got pasta which  was way better than what they had been served the night before at Verandah in the Four Seasons hotel. A perfect Caesar salad and excellent service as well and Burger Bar is a good value. We'll go back again.",2,3
"I would rate this as OK. The rooms are OK  but not great. We were satisfied  but not impressed. The casino and dining are fine also. The New York feel is cool. The location is good. Overall this is a good place to stay and a good value.",5,5
"Pretty hit or miss.  Cornbread was great  the place was really empty when we went  but/so the service was great  nice and conversational.  We got the salsa trio and the red salsas were great.  Other than that  the chicken tortilla soup  crab spinach dip  catfish tacos  and the stuffed poblano pepper were really all rather unremarkable and I can't say I recommend a visit.",4,5
"Like the mistress you brag about to your buddies... But have to keep secret to some you know  because you know if the secret gets out to everyone  your whole life will change... I have eaten there four times lately  and even with the rabble-rousing reports of another store in their chain~ They are a treasure I could enjoy daily!  Figuring out the menu  enjoying the service  compiling a mounting list of Must-have stand-by's that I wouldn't want to live without~ To the list that many great minds have sited: Dates stuffed with an almond  wrapped in bacon  wrapped in bacon and resting in red-wine reduction  sprinkled with Bleu crumbles~ Do the math! (Or the Chemistry!) Fillet with mushroom on a skewer  covered in a veg-mix that I don't want to describe~ You tell me~ Ham and cheese croquettes~ crunchy  smokey  Cheesy! A fantastic compliment to everything aforementioned~ Best staff in Vegas at the bar  but a big busy floor~ I get that a bit  but I'm always happy leaving  regardless of what I spend~ Value is always excellent! Updates will have to happen~",4,5
"I really think I'm spoiled when it comes to buffet's.  The Bellagio knocks my socks off  so the Golden Nugget just makes them slouch.  Honestly  if you go to the Bellagio on the weekend for brunch and get the bottomless mimosas...the Golden Nugget is just the same price.  I can say though that they have a made to order sauteed shrimp bar that we just couldn't get enough of.  We kept going back to try the different combinations of flavors (garlic  spicy  etc).  It's a push for me....I think if I stayed in old Las Vegas I would hit up the Golden Nugget Buffet but if we stayed at the HR as we always do  I probably won't make the trek.",5,3
"So glad we found this place. The staff us very friendly  and they accommodate some of my picker tastes. (For example  I could live without the garlic ponzu sauce or mayonnaise for the rest of my life.) They have a wide selection of signature rolls  including a section of spicy rolls  which appealed to me. I tried the Call 911 and I Need Water rolls; both made me happy. The Cocaine Salad was delicious. The giant shrimp was a little too sweet for me  but my wife loved it.",1,1

Don't be fooled by their shelves though  because their warehouse is right across the street so make sure to ask for your size if you don't see it.  Customer service here is great; they are really nice people who try to get to know you and find out how you heard of them.  Cool kicks  and screen tees galore.

"My 2 1/2 year old son has come here twice this year.  Once for a finger that got a door closed on it  and another for a respiratory issue and 103.4 fever.  The two times were both towards the time they open  and so the wait time wasn't bad at all.  Everyone from the front desk to the X-ray tech  to the Doctor was pleasant and helpful.  My only wish was that they had perhaps some toys or something more to keep kids entertained.  That said they do play movies on the TV and have tons of books.  Nobody likes having a sick child in need of relief overnight or on a holiday  but this is a fantastic resource!",2,2
"This place is pretty good. Along the same quality...hmmm...maybe in between tokuri tei and imanas tei. 4 stars for it being this good and in las vegas....be wary of the sushi tho  i dont think las vegas gets the good stuff? evrytime i try chutoro in the mainland I am absolutely appalled at what they call chutoro  but I may be spoiled by japan. I think what they consider chu and what america calls chu is chu different. ha ha bad joke!",5,5
"My son is fearless and has always had a love for water. I started him in regular swim lessons at just 6 months old at my gym. I wasn't happy with the teaching that he received there so I moved him to a swim school. Again I didn't feel like they were teaching him to survive  and as a parent that was what I was most concerned with. We tried 3 different swim programs by the time he was 2.  A friend of mine sent me the link for ISR. The second I saw the Miles Video I knew this was the training I had spent 2 years looking for.   I am so thankful for the training that ISR and Tracy Herbst have given to my children. I can honestly say that it saved my son's life and without it I would be in mourning. It was a beautiful spring day and our family got together for a cook out at my in-laws house. All of us were in the pool having a great time. When it was time to eat  I got my kids out of the pool  changed them into dry clothes and shoes and fed them dinner.  After eating  my son who was almost 3 at the time wanted to go play on the playground with his 6 year old cousin.  Unfortunately  to get to the playground the kids have to walk around the pool. I was standing about 10 yards from the pool and I watched both the boys walk out to the playground.  I turned around to grab my dinner when I heard my father in law say Courtney  Tyler is in the pool.  30 seconds hadn't even gone by from the time I watched them go around the corner till now. I looked at the pool and saw little ripples in the water  and then I saw Tyler.  I didn't hear a splash or anything. There he was fully clothed in a pull-up with shoes on  floating in the middle of the pool with a HUGE smile on his face.  I honestly  didn't know if I should smile or cry. I was so proud of him for floating  but so angry he had jumped in without an adult  but most of all so very thankful that he was ok. My kids love Ms. Tracy. It's been almost 8 months since their last lesson and they still ask me to go swimming at Ms. Tracy's house. Tracy started training my daughter when she was 8 months old and my son when he was 2. Friends and family who have seen my children swim and float are amazed at their abilities at such a young age. I tell Tracy all the time  she taught my children to survive in water and has saved their lives.  Tyler proved it to be true that day.",5,3
"I have heard a few things about this place from my coworker  she absolutely loves the Benedict.  My coworkers and I always pass by but never really end up eating here  mistake! It wasn't until I was at the Phoenix airport and I ran into a New Yorker and we randomly started chatting about food in Arizona ...and she claimed they have pizza that is comparable to NY.  Well well... I thought must try this next week!  You walk into a really clean and open ambiance  I love the natural lighting.  The staff was very friendly  however I wish they would recommend us dishes more  everyone we asked kind of said everything is just good.  Lots of options from sandwiches to pizzas to breakfast foods.  Now on to the food!   Endive Salad- my coworker got this  she is vegetarian and she loved the apple combination with the blue cheese  they gave her two different kinds of salad dressings one was something like a honey mustard and the other was this spicy mustard and horse radish.  The spicy mustard one went well with everything! We dipped our pizza in it  our french dip  and the french fries.  Overall a very fresh salad  the blue cheese taste is really strong so a caution if you are not into that.    French dip-  I really enjoyed the dip  sometimes french dip sauce is overly salty but this was a clear beef broth that was simmered to perfection.  I liked the overall sandwich but I'm a fan of medium rare beef.  This french dip was well done  it wasn't dry though so that was good  I wish they could somehow have their beef with a medium rare option.  Comes with french fries and a salad.    Pizza- The name of the pizza totally slipped my mind.  It's the 3rd one up from the bottom of the menu  the one with the egg in the middle (sorry!).  We got extra basil on top for some extra freshness.  I am a big fan of brick oven pizza and this one takes the prize.  The crust is perfectly flaky and the sauce is not too sour like most places.  I don't want to hype this up so just go try it and see for yourself.  Hopefully you come out as happy as I was.    Overall  I feel like when I'm done eating pizza and sandwiches at other places it feels heavy and I have a super lethargic afternoon. Cafepino does not have that heavy feeling and that usually correlates with fresh ingredients! I am looking forward to trying more things on the menu  see you again soon.",4,1
"Excellent spicy food and excellent service.  I am so excited to have this place now so close to my home.",4,2
"La Piazza Al Forno  LOVE IT!!!  Wife and I tried this place after driving by it several times  but after seeing Guy on DDD (Diners  Drive-in's and Dives) and glad we did! Amazing pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna was really good and not like anything I had before.  Count on it  we will be back!!",1,2
"This location is ok. The staff is friendly. The location could use a regular deep cleaning with attention to detail",4,3
"The drinks are absolutely amazing here!! they are soo creative and tasty! the place is beautiful and the bartenders are very skilled!",5,5
"If you wanna feel fulfilling at a reasonable price. This is the right place to go. The premium steak was juicy and huge! A must-go in Vegas. The only problem is it is too popular  need to wait for a while before you can get in.",5,5
