I got Japanese strengthening/ Magic perm and and got haircut as well. I am so glad that I tried this place. He reminded me of a stylist I used to go see in San Francisco. He said he is from LA. I was always looking for good stylist who know how to deal with Asian hair. Jim is an excellent stylist and their price is great! He exceeded my expectation. No more using flat iron in the mornings! He said they also do digital perming.  He charged me $220 for straightening perm and haircut! Salons in Scottsdale quoted me $500-600 for straightening perm. I am going back for coating soon. I recommend this place to anyone especially Asian gals seeking excellent cuts."

I was extremely bewildered when I noticed a Serendipity 3 location on the Strip  having not visited in recent years  I was not in the know on the recent developments. It's an interesting idea to bring a beloved NY tourist trap to the strip  the decor was all too familiar  only at a larger scale. The food is about the same  and whoever thought of the takeout window is genius. Though  a more appealing take out sundae container would have made the experience more exquisite. Seeing my sundae sloshing around in a clear cup was not entirely appetizing."
"sabHmB_1S2qKJ8O96c13DA","OdCQiwCHdgQ5RcBUdmU4-w",-0.0176211453744,1,"This incident happened on July 5  2009 at the Sticky Fingers in Concord  NC. For weeks the local restaurant ignored my repeated telephone calls to discuss the matter. On October 22  October 23  and October 24  I mailed identical letters to three different individuals at the Sticky Fingers headquarters at 300 West Coleman Blvd  Suite 101 in Mount Pleasant  SC; all of them included photocopies of my 7/5/09 receipt  my return address  and my telephone number  and made it clear that I was not looking for any restitution but did want to discuss the matter.  It's the end of December now  weeks since then without reply. I feel justified in exposing the matter more widely.  Before our visit to Sticky Fingers  my wife and I had no symptoms of ill health  and had entirely different foods and drinks for breakfast and lunch. At Sticky Fingers  though  we ate the same food (pulled pork) and the same drink (half lemonade / half diet cola). I ate and drank about 50% more than my wife. After we paid the bill  I felt the need to use the restroom and barely made it in time to use the toilet there.  I met my wife at the car and she teased me a little since it's more typical for me to wait for her to use the bathroom. About five minutes after leaving the Sticky Fingers parking lot  she was desperate herself and crying for me to get back to the house as soon as possible. She also had an unnaturally urgent bowel movement.  I am not unsympathetic to the challenges facing the food service industry. Before 8pm that evening  I calmly phoned the local restaurant at 704-979-7427 and spoke with the shift manager. I hoped to warn him that he likely had an issue  and I suspected his ice machine (based on my wife's expertise). The shift manager claimed that the ice machine is thoroughly cleaned twice a day  which seems a blatant falsehood but I didn't argue. I explicitly assured the shift manager that I wasn't looking for anything but the safety of his customers and he assured me that a manager would soon return my call. No one has returned any of my calls.  My wife  a food service professional herself  asked me to write directly to Sticky Fingers headquarters with these facts and again emphasize that I'm not looking for anything but improved practices at Sticky Fingers restaurants. Weeks later  my wife and I have both been surprised and dismayed that a chain would treat a serious complaint so dismissively. Apparently the local restaurants just follow the customers-should-get-lost example of chain headquarters."

We never asked why they were in line...I guess we'll never know :P  So our group of six sat down after about 30 minutes  not too bad. We ended up sharing the jalapeno poppers  not too spicy  even a wimp like me could handle these. The catch was that one of the six had all the jalapeno seeds stuffed in it. Thankfully I avoided this tragic fate  because I probably would have been in the bathroom for the rest of the night  dropping off fireballs. I'm terrible with spicy haha.  We also got the truffle fries (YES  AMAZING)  onion rings (crunchy  but still flavorful  not the over-fried dry onions that you can sometimes run into)  and regular fries (meh  OK). I got the Britannia burger  which I highly recommend. Sharp cheddar with mango chutney. MANGO? In a burger? YES and it works so well! Not too sweet  but just enough flavor to make you go  ohhh  yesssss.

We sat for a long time  just talking and lingering over the food. I probably would have had leftovers if I hadn't been there so long to eat slowly. We also at a tiramisu what was AMAZING.

I also know that had a show on a cable network that I have never seen. With that being said  Hubby and I wanted to see a show in Vegas and did not want to break the bank so we saw Penn and teller. He is a fan so I tagged along. We went to the Half off ticket booth early on a Tuesday and purchased tickets for the show. We saw the 9pm show.. I must say they started before 9pm  maybe about 8:57 or so  so do not be late.   The show was REALLY good. I enjoyed it  from beginning to end. They have a lot of audience participation so if you are interested in being chosen get floor front area seats.  I actually can only remember one trick they actually explained and it was interesting. The time does go by quick because they show is good and funny. for someone that doesn't talk  that Teller is a hoot!  If you are in Vegas for a couple of days and you have some time for an late show  check them out. Arrive on time and I think it would be best to go to the Tickets 4 tonight discount and get them cheaper.  I love saving money.

This Dilworth bar/restaurant has been renamed so many times in the past few years. However  I am happy to say that I'm a big fan of The Deck!  Some friends and I strolled over to The Deck to grab a few drinks after dinner. Inside  it reminds me of a Charleston-style restaurant - very beach focused with a large bar and a smattering of tables. We were interested in actually sitting on the deck  at The Deck  so we rolled on upstairs and grabbed a table with a view of East Blvd. My review is solely based on their drinks  but I'm definitely interested in heading back for some nosh!  The drink menu is really diverse and our friendly server mentioned that they do their best to use natural ingredients - they even make their own sour mix in house. The five of us ordered all different drinks - beer  wine  and I ordered the Deck margarita. The margarita was right on par for $9  it was fairly large and had pleeenty of salt on the rim. Mmm sodium.  All of our drinks were tasty and priced moderately for the area.

I really love this place.   The food is cheap  filling and incredibly tasty. The menu is quite limited  but what it lacks in variety it more than makes up in the yum stakes. There's enough on offer for meat eaters and veggies alike to be satisfied.   You can get a large plate of lentil dhal and rice for \u00a33 and a freshly made nan bread for \u00a31. Other things on offer include a spinach dish  vegetable curry  lamb curry and chicken curry  as well as garlic nans  samosas and a few other bits and pieces. Portion sizes are large and very enjoyable - a bit of a rarity in Edinburgh these days!   Don't expect airs and graces. The place is canteen style and you'll be eating your grub off paper plates with plastic cutlery. The decor is clean and contemporary  with long tables happily accommodating ten people or more. The food is served buffet style and the service is quick but a little abrupt.   I was told that the Mosque Kitchen's profits go towards funding the mosque and that the staff are volunteers  so I'm not surprised that the service can sometimes be a little lacking in finesse (that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars).   If you want something sweet to round off your meal  cakes and pastries are available starting at around \u00a31.

I came here this weekend...the lobsters were fine this time around  big ol' plump tails  sashimi was great but the filet mignon  the rack of lamb and the prime rib...all overcooked and of a slightly lesser quality than what they've had in the past. The rack of lamb is my favorite meat and it was bland and overcooked  not the tasty  tender red meat with the rosemary I was used to. In fact  Bachannal buffet at Caesar's puts out a better lamb on their buffet. Was a bit disappointed...and the prime rib wasn't top notch like years past.  The desserts have been a continual slide  though still ok...I'll mention though  back in the day 1/3 of the dessert bar didn't consist of cupcakes.

Canadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly  and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast  after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.  He's already at a table when I walk in  sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll  split in half  grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says Guy from Diners  Drive-ins  and Dives was here. Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement  who knew Canada got the food network?  I ordered the oatmeal pancakes  knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.  He ordered the raspberry french toast  over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon  a large OJ  coffee  and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat  and he's so thin  I really hate him and his metabolism.

In any buffet  it's usually expected that the quality of the food will not have the same attention as a regular sit down joint because  let's face it  buffet food is cooked in bulk and sometimes quality is lost. I did not experience that with Studio B. Crab Legs were not over cooked  oysters nice and plump  wide variety of pastas and dessert  you can choose from Gelato and various other oven baked goodies! All of the things that I always look for :) BTW  some sugar-free desserts available!  It's a very large Buffet  high ceilings  modernized decor and there's also a seating area that has a view of the Strip. We haven't had any issues with service  plates are cleared and drinks are refilled  usually upon request but I don't knock them for that because most times that we eat there  it's during the peak hours so they're usually running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

Cool change of weather. Our server was attentive and nice. Can you tell I'm holding out? I'm refraining from going on about how bad the food was. But I cannot help it now. The chips and salsa are so bland and plain. The salsa is like hot watery cilantro puree. Flat  bland  and uninspiring. And... they charge you $2 for the pleasure. Are you kidding me?   My gf ordered the taco salad with BLACKENED Mahi. The fish came out under cooked and mushy. Not even an attempt at the blackened part of the equation. The salad was a heap of shit. Just a pile of stuff thrown haphazardly into a shell  that was food colored green. Maybe it was a spinach taco shell  but it looked like a food colored taco shell.   I ordered the fajitas. I pulled SEVERAL large chunks of gristly meat out of the plate. The shrimp was poorly packaged  over frozen  overcooked  and tasted flat and bland. That was after I had picked through the onions. Also  someone may want to put an APB out on the Bell Pepper. Large  green  red  or orange type pepper found in fajitas and other dishes. Mine had escaped. Yes. really. No bell peppers in my fajitas. The beans were canned Rosarita beans. Same bland garbage that can be bought in a store. Black beans  canned as well.   So why the 2 stars? The drinks were good. They have a margarita that is fresh squeezed and made from scratch that is awesome. The mango marg is great  my gf liked the Prickly Pear marg  and the house marg is not bad. Service was good too.

A full buffet of Filipino food is what made this trip different than all my other trips to Vegas! Kusina ni Lorraine(Lorraine's Kitchen?) used to be called Lolas. It is located off the strip in a Filipino plaza. (Filipinos taking over!? First Manny  now the buffet industry??) Good: - the grub. Besides the typical Pancit  lumpia  adobo  they had other favorites of mine such as beef steak  kare kare(dish made with peanut butter) and other items I cannot pronounce nor spell..(sad  I know) - Family owned.

PpkKVodWC0sdn74TbHQLzA,kkKNXbOmDPOYuR5qsjY84w,0.105263157895,5,Super Cool Gallery/Bar... Art /Booze/Schmooze as they say!  Does this place make Art look better or do they only choose great Art to suit the space?  Maybe Both! !! !!!    This is a GREAT Looking spot!  At night you get a preview before entering because the glass front and part of one side is Huge Modern Display Storefront!  During the day the black curtains add mystique and amplify natural curiosity!  One of the coolest Galleries in Charlotte and as my friends who say I'll met you in the Bar will only be a few chairs from those of us who are: just here for the Art!  This Gallery offers one of the most diverse ranges of styles and Artists I have noticed.  It seems each exhibit is remarkably different than the previous.

Either something broke again after they repaired it or they didn't fix it at all  or something.  Chances are pretty good I'll be back here again  (hopefully Doug will be back from vacation by then) but for now  two stars.
fVVsjf9vHd2Nx6D2IEJT8g,lKESFH7NedlFBnl0kegDKw,0.00555555555556,2,I was in the neighborhood and my fella decided to get a haircut next door. I needed to get my nails done as part of my bridesmaid's duties  so I figured why not knock out two birds with the one stone. Why oh why didn't I check reviews?   Ok  my bad for choosing gel polish. I knew that the nails needed to last several days  and that I wouldn't have time when I got back into San Diego  so I went with them. Weeks later and my nails still haven't recovered  even after I carefully followed the instructions on how to remove them.   I would argue that what followed is a hazard of gel polish  but there are things they could have done to improve the situation. My polish started peeling off at the tips  (thank goodness waiting the whole 3 days I needed it for)  snagging up my carefully grown nails right before my own wedding. I don't know why they didn't seal the tips  but they didn't and they started peeling from there down. I immediately tried to remove them  but it was too late  my nails started ripping off  sometimes below the quick.   Okay  gel polish. Fail. But one of my pet peeves is when people are over aggressive about cuticle trimming  and not only do I have some rough patches on my fingertips from the process  she managed to slice open my finger something fierce.      Finally  my wedding ring is an heirloom. Don't ask me to just set it on a table so you can lotion up my hands. Work around the damn thing if you have to  I don't feel comfortable removing it  especially in an unknown place.   I was willing to ignore a few hiccups. The gal was actually really nice  which is better than many places I've been too. But it's been over a month and my nails still are showing the damage and my fingertips are all rough and I just wish I'd waited and gone to Trany's in San Diego rather than chose this place out of convenience.
z-FQldMmPi2PT87UaAw40A,_wrA7CMbMqcWEDCNghi5cg,0.0724637681159,2,I have seen this location go downhill. We keep going back thinking that it will  be better than the last time  but it's not.   It has a rundown feel to it. It's not that the decor is bad  it's pretty new  it's the service and the attitude of the staff that is rundown. Despite the food being good  the service really has deteriorated and the management doesn't seem to have noticed  or even care.   Everything is now an extra  50c there  $1 there  portions are smaller  and it all mounts up. The entrees are already just under $10 for many things. It's not THAT good that I would pay much more for what they are offering. So  it's goodbye Mimi's  it was good while it lasted  but I am done!

This hidden gem offers a flavorful twist to the curry most of us are used to and couples it with tasty protein choices. The service is excellent and the prices are very economical. You must check this place out!
8ZkRvohNxHR_3heRtFwAgQ,Qjl6aqudDq7LJYEC8uCkdw,0.015444015444,1,Went here on a Tuesday night with my mate with an itison voucher for 8 Tapas dishes. Had been looking forward to the meal all day and had even skipped lunch to build up an appetite for the array of Tapas dishes I imagined I'd be presented with.   The menu has an extensive selection of dishes which I was pleased with. After a long discussion  we picked 4 dishes each and placed our order. We were informed that they were out of 3 of the items ordered so we quickly picked replacements.   I went for battered prawns with a lemon mayo  Braised pork cheeks in red wine and port  skewered chicken satay  and breaded Brie with cranberry sauce.   My mate had the Spanish Chorizo in red wine  Gambas pil pil  hot chicken wings and the crispy prawns.   - The battered prawns were soggy and the lemon mayo was just plain mayo - Braised pork cheeks weren't really braised enough so were tough and inedible with a watery sauce - the skewered chicken was dry and the satay sauce was just peanut butter - the Brie was actually Camembert melted in a shallow bowl (this was replaced with the breaded Brie later) - Chorizo was greasy but ok - Gambas pil pil was quite good - hot chicken wings did not have crispy skin and were just greasy and soggy and  not very appetising.  I can't fathom how a trained chef can get 7 out of 8 dishes wrong!   Stay well away from the food unless they replace the chef and/or the menu!
glRXVWWD6x1EZKfjJawTOg,NmEXZjVH9Mq0Vy63hSDMDA,0.0811808118081,4,For a while  I've been wanting to go to this famed taco trailer as I've heard from Nelson Q. that this was the place for cabeza and lengua tacos.   It was a bit confusing so I've had failed attempts so let me try to clear up as much information as possible. Firstly  it used to be called Karinas 2 and it is now Sinaloa. So if you're looking for that  then what you're looking for is Sinaloa. Way before  they used to be by Oakey by Luv- Its then moved to this side of town. .Now it WAS on the corner of Vegas Dr and Decatur Blvd.but it has since moved... You will see a cart at that gas station and that's some new vendor. They are now at Billy Macs Auto lot on Decatur and Lake Mead. Now my goal for next time is to get their hours  but for now the best bet is to go later in the day. Oh yeah  they take cash AND card which is unusual for a taco cart.   It is pretty basic what they offer. Meats : carne asada  al pastor/adobada  chorizo  lengua  cabeza. You can get it as tacos  tortas  burritos  quesadillas or mulitas. They have some sodas and horchata.   So the positives -   HANDMADE TORTILLAS. So when corn tortillas are fresh they tend to soft and fluffy of a consistency than mass produced ones  even the better brands. They also make fresh flour tortillas  but I did not try them on this visit  but will one day. I love that they offer fresh tortillas here  which separates them from a lot of taco spots.   We tried  Adobada - pretty solid. It's not my favorite one in town  but pretty good.  Cabeza - really nice and now sinewy/fatty like some can be which was a plus for the BF.  Lengua - theirs was good. The BF is weird about how some can be a bit gelatinous  but this was meaty and none at all. He just prefers a smaller dice than big cuts like this  but it was tender and delicious to me.   Packed ours to go and it stayed well the 5 minutes to get to my MILs place. They packed up salsas for us  but we hit the salsa bar for some of the extras like the diced up pineapples  pickled carrots and peppers  pickled onions  more limes  etc.   It was pretty fast and efficiently run and seemed pretty clean inside from what I can see when their side door was open. The meats are solid  the fresh made tortillas are a huge plus. Definitely one of the better taco carts around and I will definitely be back to try more. First impression and first visit though was very good so go!   If you need more convincing and some pictures  check out the old reviews of the previous locations. I made a new one because it is really hard to convince Yelp to change addresses for such a small  barely reviews place-  Karinas when it was at Decatur/Vegas - http://www.yelp.com/biz/karinas-2-las-vegas-2#query:Karinas%202 Karinas when it was in Downtown - http://www.yelp.com/biz/karinas-2-las-vegas#query:Karinas%202
jx021JgSzi7TVOMEIJWv-Q,ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA,-0.00831600831601,3,I was torn on how to rank this. There is part of me that wants to go a little lower  but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star.   This Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space  we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud  but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud  rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.    Additional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very  very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day  not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one  there is none during the day  and  most frustrating  in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind  but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.  I also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that  the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm  which is our daughters naptime  and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service  it was hit or miss. One day was great  replenished our towels  toiletries  took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom  zero toiletries replenished  and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. A call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  Also  the in-room fridge does not fully work  and our hummus  juices  and other snacks were spoiled.   I get that this is the area's biggest conference center  so maintaining business is not a problem for them. However  for those of us who travel frequently and experience many Marriott properties  this one does not come up to scratch  but again  the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.
rqXxtESmHX1mC-boCKkbug,zp5k6funVelIOVuqdY0mDA,0.29347826087,5,Love  love  love this place!!! Delicious  decent price. Clean environment.  Fun place to go on date night or a special treat for the kids. If you get a chance  meet the owners. They truly appreciate their customers which is so nice. I saw them at Costco once and they went out of their way to say 'hi' to me. What a great small business. I will continue to support them because they deserve my business. TIP - This place gets busy so if you see a table getting ready to vacate  grab it!
z-otxOSXh0Rnu18xCtKxcg,Hx1Af23Po2bojH1ItEtCrA,0.0819672131148,5,This place has the best Service ... I know there stuff can be pricey but you get what you pay for..  had to take my phone in made an online apt. and was in and out in no time at all.. Just make sure you always back up before you take your stuff in that made a huge difference.. I LOVE APPLE..
i8KMQX7nekLSCzb_DVb6yA,wvAltxmc-qhw-oQtmyXRiw,0.152671755725,4,I'll get this out of the way first - I do see the comparison to Chipotle  but I personally don't even like Chipotle but really enjoy this place!   The menu is much larger than Chipotle's and has some yummy things I haven't seen other places. I'm a sucker for their pesto sauce - it's incredible. They also offer sweet potatos and regular potatos for your bowls or burritos. Their queso is pretty awesome too  we always have to get a side of it! Prices are on the high side  but the quality is great. When I'm low carbing I get a bowl with a smidgen of black beans  white meat chicken  lettuce  tomatoes  sour cream  cheese  and pesto sauce and I'm a happy camper indeed!
NhCE1r5RPWN3Q0GveOx6kw,g68i6-Bbu7uYQOKOQX8Hsw,0.261904761905,4,I was very pleased about the haddock ( fried).  It was done just right.  The service was excellent.  There was a 40 minute wait on Friday night.  We arrived at 7pm.  The coffee was excellent.  I really like the down home atmosphere.
R005MrvgUEgCW_V4I-f3nw,D3a0vrdXzT_UkbPNhK8f7w,0.0636363636364,3,I'm disappointed. I came with such high hopes from other reviews and found that the burgers are not that fabulous after all.    Yes yes. I love the vibe  I am curious and am planning to be back for live music.   The place was kinda confusing.. I entered from the front door at state street  saw a drumset and a bar but there was no one to help us. So my boy and I headed to the area at the dark area at the back and finally saw something like a reception. FYI  there's the front bar and back bar....  So what to try? Cheese curds was good as mentioned. The crumbs were special  reminding me of a fish fry batter at Long John Silver's if you ever had it. But i still prefer the ones at Graze cos the ones at fountain have empty cheese curds (batter with no cheese) Fried onion straws - similar to the old fashioned.   Skip the following  BOO!!! Pulled pork sliders. Not enough sauce so the pork was rather dry. Taste was good. And it was cheap and came with chips.. The server was so puzzled about us getting the 2 free toppings -.- Fountain burger - no patties here please. It was supposed to be medium rare and turned out charred on all sides

wERsQgiwwh1e0HEJrgp7dg,3bx6Se8Fu8D6tzGfpW2oqQ,0.031746031746,2,We went to Verses for brunch on a Sunday in September  and were disappointed to find out there were only 2-3 other tables occupied.  The food is very standard and uninspired  but the service was OK.  At least the setting is nice and they have free valet (might be the only reason we would go back!).  Go for lunch or dinner.
tvXM9NGfiQIEAnvkOSQo1w,Lp-A-JNRUUH72uou5-pMtQ,0.115384615385,5,I'm a huge sucker for Cajun food. It's a little disheartening that they seem a bit scarce in Vegas. But  thanks to Yelp  I was able to discover this place.  I went here for a late dinner. The location is a bit hidden. It's a hard place to spot since most eyes look to the Holsum Bread factory when driving by. The entire place has this sort of local groove that I feel in the atmosphere. The entrance is left open to the patio  with a clear view of the downtown lights in sight. Sets a real good casual mood to accompany the meal.  I ended up ordering the bronzed catfish and grits  while the person I was with ordered the crab cake dinner. Portions are definitely not as heavy as you'd expect from Cajun food  to which I'm used to getting immense servings. I guess the focus is more reliant on quality than on quantity; which was definitely shown here.  -Bronzed catfish & grits: I absolutely loved this meal. The catfish in itself very tender  succulent and flavorful. The grits that accompanied the fish were outstanding. They were made with a smoked gouda cheese  which added an awesome twist to usual grits that I'm used to. I could see me coming back here just for this dish. The meal left me trying to clean my plate off with my spoon to get every drop out of it.  -Crab cake dinner: These crab cakes are served on top of some greens. Seemed more like a salad type of deal. After I swooped in to steal a sample from my brother's plate  I noticed a unique sweet flavor to the crab cakes.  Also worth noting is that these cakes are very crab heavy. They don't skimp you in the amount of crab they put into each cake. This looked like a very light dish though. Not something I would order if I was hungry.  -Bananas Foster: I wasn't a huge fan of this dessert. It didn't really stand out to me. I should have ordered the bread pudding  like most people recommended on here.   All in all  I was really impressed with Lola's. I do see myself coming back here for my local Cajun fix. Consider myself a new fan.
dVhqTWY7dVLsNFUn3R9tvg,2z18V6w-GXzd80eOm1bscA,-0.0710900473934,1,I'm really appalled at how the management handled a situation here the other night.   There was a group of people drinking by the pool  husbands  wives  and their toddlers  and a physical fight broke out between two drunk women.  There was punching and screaming and eventually the womens husbands separated them.  Later the woman swung at her husband and then the husband punched her back in her face and knocked her to the ground.  The night shift manager went out to tell them they had to leave  talked to them  etc and he came into the lobby/dining area that our group was sitting in and we had been watching the whole thing through the window.  We asked him what it was all about and he said that a fight broke out  and he was not going to call the cops because the husbands out there were cops. Which doesn't make any sense. And then he said to us but personally I don't mind if two women are fighting in a pretty perverted way.   I was shocked that the hotel manager would make light of domestic violence and also be so creepy about it.  Also  the complimentary breakfast was a joke.  There were only waffles and cereal. Bleh
65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ,hElB5q25dCdtHnottJQsvA,0.165938864629,5,I've tried all kinds of things since I've started to grow a little roll in the middle. Trampolining? It's like death. Swimming? Ew. Chlorine. Fencing? Needs coordination. Yoga? Actually yoga's awesome but doesn't burn away the calorie real quick-like so then you think Ah ha! Bikram. 900 calories in 90 minutes! And Bikram yoga in the strip where you're not supposed to drink water and it's 100 degrees and 40% humidity and you start to black out (for real) is the worst thing I have ever chosen to do to myself.  But spinning? I love it. And I really like Shadyside Spin. The instructor for the class I attend is motivating without being a drill sergeant. You work to your level but are encouraged to push yourself. And after the first class I found out I pushed way too hard. But the second class sped by and felt great.   The room is clean and the bikes are nice and the whole atmosphere is very accepting of different abilities and the music is fun and sometimes funny. I never thought I'd like it (I mean  it's still exercise) but I love it. And right now there's a deal for 10 classes at $99 (or a $51 savings  which is sort of incredible.) So  yeah. You should do it."
"9ZIr8IZzXsZcyBm7E7w5Ag","mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA",0.00681818181818,1,"I am a new resident to the City of Charlotte. In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area  to celebrate my friends Birthday  we came across this quant  place. bypassing 5star gourmet restaurants we opted to have  a quite dinner with some soul food. The restaurant was interestingly decorated  and the menu was appetizing.  The service on the other hand was not.  I had never tried shrimp and grits before  so I being a special occasion I decided to try something new. when the dish came to the table the presentation was nice however the taste was not satisfactory. it was overloaded with onion and It was not enjoyable to me. So I then asked the waitress if something could be done because I didn't like  the dish. She told me I have to get the manager  because I can't change once the food is on the table.  I told her that was fine. The manager never came to offer any apologies nor explain what the solution could be. the waitress comes back after like 15mn and says She says pick something of the menu and we'll trade it out. I then chose the chicken dinner. The waitress nor the food did not come back for almost another 20mn. she then comes to the table not to refill drinks or to apologize for the wait. but to offer to bag up the meal and bring the check. at this point I was embarrassed for bringing my friend to this place and irritated because I was hungry and very annoyed with the service I told her yes please bring the check. she brings a check not only with the meal I changed for but also the initial meal that I did not eat. I was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress. that waitress says sure she's the lady over there in the red shirt.  and walks the other way.  So I then call the manager over to clarify that this was a mistake. she says If the owner was here he would not be playing with y'all. He would make you pay for both. I on the other hand will take it off. I was floored at the way she spoke to me and the fact that the owner would make a patron pay for something they didn't like. I felt stereo typed and embarrassed that it was my people to treat us this way. So needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever! I hope this is not hospitality in Charlotte."

Empty restaurant  and they would not let 18 people sit and eat. Their policy  is  no teams.  We had 6 high school girls and 12 parents.  The hostess politely  said they have had teams cause problems.  Well  this policy just cost them. None of these 12 parents will ever return. So I can't tell you how the food is. Just don't walk in as a large group. That is my tip."

"t9dSBPONLTj7dpTsd1sJnQ","ZhMlXLXuZf5z7lxunHk2ww",0.237588652482,5,"I have to revamp my review of this lovely establishment. This restaurant has blown me away with the best service and food I could possibly ask for. That is really saying a lot because I am pretty demanding at times.   Lets start with Steve - the most amazing bartender I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He always puts a huge smile on my face and goes far above and beyond to make my experience at Eddie V's perfect. He always knows what I like to drink  makes my martini's perfect every time and when my beverage gets a little warm - he changes my glass - OMG I love him!  You know when you just finished eating and your beverage has been untouched while you eat - and the second I go to drink it again - Steve is swapping glasses for a cold one.  In addition  the management actually ordered Creme de Violet for me because I love it w/Hendricks Gin. I feel overwhelmed with love.   Moving on to the fares - WOW! Best filet I have EVER had - and I have had a few. The cut is always perfect  the temperature is always perfect and they sear the outside until crisp - whoa baby! The simplest dish - roasted corn - tastes like heaven too. Who would think corn could be so sweet and crisp? They rock it.  Lobster tacos - need I say more? I think not!! Amazing!  I really hope this place stays in business forever and I will eat here as long as I can. This is a jewel in the city of Scottsdale where most restaurants don't care if you are happy.   Keep up the good work Eddie V's."
"z_jPW7L4mMotYXMo4-R7Lg","VNfCMuY4vnqi_nW5WnZ5Lw",0.035,5,"To all the previous reviewers who compared the Chef Store to local grocery stores: This is a walk in store for RESTAURANT OWNERS to shop for resale for what their chefs need  in case they have to pick up items that may not have been on their regular delivery truck from a food purveyor or they ran out of something  OR they like the freedom to browse new products that that otherwise haven't crossed their minds during their daily routine in the kitchen. The Chef Store just happened to open it up to the public  not for y'all to attempt to compare it to something you were looking for in a regular grocery store. (A restaurant owner will not regularly go to Frys to buy the quantity of pasta that they need for resale for 49 cents per pound. It's a waste of their time  and you cannot make tax exempt purchases at retail stores  FYI) As a local business owner  I am very thankful to have the convenience of The Chef Store without the pain of driving downtown for the Restaurant Depot (which is not for the public).

After a long walk along the waterfront we were surprised to see so much action at Place Jacques Cartier.  At the heart of this location is Rue Saint-Paul  the oldest street in Montreal  first paved in 1672!  There were quite a variety of restaurants (and many places to shop if that's your thing) at the plaza  and even a few bars with live music along the waterfront  but Jardin Nelson caught our attention because they were offering live jazz in the center of their garden-centric dining area.    We were outdoors  but the giant umbrellas (and I mean huge) overhead  flowing gardens and colorful lighting gave it a wonderfully intimate feel.  The jazz band was outstanding (just the right volume too) and the service quite solid.  I enjoyed a charcuterie pizza  which was divided into four sections  each with a different Italian meat.  Their Barbera complemented it perfectly.    When in town you need to go to the historic district  and once the restaurant is freshly renovated  make sure you stop by  particularly if you appreciate live music."

The food is great and the Chef always watches people take their first bite.  I have tried most things on the menu over the years and have never been disappointed.  I agree that maybe the prices could be lower; but I've never run a restaurant so I don't know whether the prices are fair or not.

Paris is not one of those properties that come to mind when people in Vegas think of nightlife but they sure have been trying for quite a while.  The ambiance is tired and the club itself is a little too dated to be more posh than it really is.  The bouncers and staff still try to pass off the place as it if it's Tao or Tryst  but even they know there is not much going on here other than the occasional eye candy that most clubs will have anyway.  Drinks are over priced and weak.  The plastic cups are typically filled with lots of ice  enough to where the drink is barely more than a shot's worth of alcohol with something else (like gin & tonic or coke & bourbon).  It is more disappointing when the bartenders don't care about their drinks and complain about the drinks.  It's only saving grace is their DJ line up.  A lot of up-and-comers are busting out their scratches here and really making the dance floor what it is was intended to be.  My favorite night here so far is Latin night.  They pump out some cool Latin hits and mix it with a sick track to make it a hell of a rendition.  Plenty of cute girls and guys galore  and its hot in here especially during the summer.  It could be a little more Risque  but they need a lot of work done before it gets back to that level."

Guy behind the counter said pick where ever you want to sit. Thumbs up  even better. Sit towards the back of the restaurant. Waiter comes out to give us the menu  small chitchat  he takes our drink orders. We look over the menu  classic German fair (schnitzel  sausage  etc) I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and a side of Red Cabbage. While waiting for my food  (enjoying a Warsteiner Pilnser on tap!!) I took notice to all the decor. The German flags  the US flag and all the Berlin posters was a real nice touch of ambiance. The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods  my schnitzel was cooked perfect. The gravy that come on it was also perfect. Flavorful and delicious! The red cabbage was also cooked to perfection. Takes me back to when I was a child  eating German food with my family. After I was done with my entree  I had to order the strudel (apple) and wow  it was amazing. Talk about putting the cherry on the sundae. It was a perfect ending to an amazing meal. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. I fully and whole heartily hope this place does well. I will be visiting this place as frequently as I can. I hope everyone gets to have the same experience as I do."

I gave up on getting good Chinese in the valley several years ago because  well  you just can't find it. However  the Prime is pretty darn good.   I ordered the Beef with Broccoli and it was absolutely amazing. In fact  it is likely the most flavorful I've ever had. The broccoli was cooked to perfection  the flavor was exactly right and the beef was tender and tasty. However  the rice was over-cooked and gooey and I didn't care for the texture at all...but I rarely desire rice so this wasn't a big deal.  The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I ordered the egg drop soup and it was NOT what others have hyped it to be. It really didn't taste at all like egg drop soup..probably because it is just too busy. 9.5 years later I'm still in search of good egg drop soup in this city and I think I've given up. This looks like some sort of gravy..I'd liken it to the color of hot and sour soup  actually. There are vegetables in it..which I don't want in my egg drop soup.   Other than the egg drop  I will definitely try this place again in 8-12 months when I next crave some Chinese food."

Secondly  the rooms were tidy and well kept  if a bit on the small side. Every morning  the hotel serves free breakfast items such as bagels  croissants  yogurt  fruit and coffee/tea/juice  which was also really convenient. Lastly  the staff was pleasant and helpful. They showed us the best ways to get around the area  recommended places to eat and held on to our luggage for a few hours between our checkout and departure. The area is a bit quiet  but great dining and entertainment are very close by. Highly recommend checking out this hotel on your visit to Montreal!"

Got there at 7:30 PM  I guess (long story). We had a very nice and attentive waiter who came back often (they divided the place between waitstaff very well) and made no mistakes.  I chose a cherry limeade for my drink. I was glad to taste an actual lime flavor in a drink for once! Add in the cherry and...need I say more?  My entre\u00e9 was the Garlic Chicken pizza which ended up becoming a joke - in a good way (hhhhhello  hhhhhow's your pizza?). It was topped with loads of garlic  onions  and chicken. That's OK  though: I am an onion lover (as well as garlic).  I wanted to try the seasonal Lemon Cake  but I was too darn full...next time.  It took a bit of driving around the Biltmore Fashion Park to find it  but the extra time was worth it. Make sure you look behind the Cheesecake Factory!"
"9ITZFb1M5RvnjACTA-WfuQ","6XFsms-qsfe6XyNOIg6FOQ",0.0676470588235,4,"Checked out this restaurant during our stay in Montreal which is the sister to Reuben's  also in the same vicinity. This new place must have just gone in recently because it was not here when we visited over a year ago. Overall the vibe of this place is definitely a bit hipster meets 1950's diner (chrome and all). There was a little bit of a wait when we got there but we didn't mind at all. We were seated in probably 10 minutes or so which was quicker than we expected. Our waiter was awesome and when asked  even informed us of the best choices on the menu. From what I could see  much of the menu consisted of sandwiches  expensive steaks  a few fish choices  burgers  and salads.   First my fiance and I ordered the wontons filled with macaroni which were awesome. Very cheesy and came with a marinara dip on the side which I didn't use much. I ended up ordering the hot pulled chicken sandwich which personally  I thought was blegh. For being a hot sandwich  it wasn't hot at all. There was also a good portion of dark meat in the sandwich that I didn't eat (not a dark meat fan). My fiance ordered the brisket sandwich which he said was amazing and ate completely. Besides our food  we both got mixed drinks that I thought were a bit overpriced ($11+ a piece). Mine in particular tasted very syrupy and left a coating of sugar on my teeth. This is mainly why I don't drink mixed drinks that often anymore.  So overall I would say this place is neat and has a vibe all on it's own. I'm mainly giving this place 4 stars for the service  wonton appetizers  and decor. My food wasn't really the best and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Maybe if we visit this place again in the future  I might have a different experience with the main course."

The staff is always pleasant  and the food it top notch  while not being too top notch of a price.  It almost seems like you can't drop your fork without one of the staff catching it  but they give you plenty of room to talk without even knowing they are there.  The food is not your usual golf club food.  Their Lobster Cobb Salad is always tasty and their bread basket has a diverse selection to help start the meal.   Excellent setting  fantastic food  and great service make this a winner in my book."

It has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is  my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.   It is a bar.  It has bar food.  Nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries  sandwhiches and wings.  On the other hand  I've never had a bad experience either.  So when I eat there  I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular  but I am expecting constantcy.  Consistancy is what is delivered.   Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.   Service is spotty  I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there.  The plus is  when specific staff is working  the  place is that much of a better establishment.  Consistantly just above average in my opinion. I chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars."

"eBxhanz54AOCNXXSay9HXQ","Ht8mXLuqJSTPrU9kvzosUA",0.0928381962865,5,"had probably one of the best clubbing experiences this past weekend at Marquee with my friends. Kaskade was spinning so we knew to expect big crowds  but our group did what we were told by our promoter contact and things went smoothly. even ratio of guys to girls  showed up to guestlist line at 9pm and waited maybe 10 minutes. girls were free and guys were $45 (the price of general admission that night i think)  what truly made this a great experience was that all the bouncers were super nice and helpful. for instance  while waiting in line  the bouncer noticed that Justin B. was wearing Vans  not dress shoes. he pulled justin out of line with the promise of getting his spot back just to make sure that his shoes would get him into the club. the bouncer said he didnt want to waste our time if we couldnt even get in which i appreciated. after some nervous moments  we did get into the club. phew haha.  once inside  we were chilling up in the library since it was still relatively early and not crowded upstairs. found some seats to preserve our feet for the evening and even snagged a few games of pool too. this time upstairs  the bouncer politely told us we would have to give up our seats b/c the people who actually paid for the table were at the club. we got up  but 5 min later the same bouncer found our group and told us we could sit back down and have the area b/c the ppl canceled! us 5 girls truly loved this (although i knew better and wore flats that night haha). it was so great that the bouncer went out of his way to find us.  spent most of the time outside in the 'dayclub' portion of the club where they had video screens set up to see kaskade's set. we took over a corner of the dance floor and even snagged one of the flying swing cage chairs! main dance floors were packed inside but we had an awesome time outside. i may be a little old for the clubbing scene in vegas but i really did have an amazing time at marquee"
"OI-VGo5ij4TMHVw8xWrKNA","wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ",0.107711138311,4,"Six months ago  my husband surprised me with reservations at Joel Robuchon. I was shocked and the experience was unforgettable. I felt like Cinderella. I never imagined we'd return so soon  but he planned another dinner for us  this time  another couple joined us. I slipped on my glass slippers and eagerly awaited the night to unfold. Anticipation was high leading up to our 6:30 dinner reservation. It felt like Christmas. Santa didn't appear  but his elves were whipping up special treats in the kitchen. There was no question  we returned for the 15-course degustation menu ($435)  complete with bread and mignardises carts. Our friend also chose the $295 wine pairing. It is the bottom tier  but the wines were outstanding and perfectly paired. The husband and I opted for two half bottles  Chardonnay and a very special Red from France.  The bread cart immediately seduced us and we quickly tumbled down the rabbit hole. The four of us were giddy as can be  we were blown away again and again by the refinement of the experience.  It is glorious. It is euphoric. It is even obscene. However  this is no ordinary meal. It is art. Delectable  delicious art.  Cream of kale cabbage over delicate vegetable gelee. Kale has never tasted so good. The textures of this dish are extraordinary. It was a wonderful way to excite the palate.  Violet artichoke and foie gras salad with parmesan shavings. This was a fine dish  but not one to cause me to swoon.  Symphony of osetra caviar with salmon tartare  chilled sweet corn soup  and king crab on crustacean gelee. This was served as one breathtaking presentation  however  it counted as three-courses. The caviar and sweet corn will forever fill my dreams. It was sweet and salty and utterly perfect. I was blown away. I consumed more caviar with these dishes than I had in my existence prior to this meal.  Semi-soft boiled egg florentine with Comte cheese sauce. This was loved by everyone in the group  but me. It's funny  too  because the soft boiled egg was a favorite during our last dinner. That version seemed to have enough to offset the richness of the egg. This one felt like I had consumed a dozen farm fresh eggs.   Seared scallop with lemongrass  broccolini and soybean sprouts cooked as risotto. This dish was well executed. Apparently  I've been eating overcooked scallops my whole life. These were scrumptiously medium rare.  Thin veloute of porcini mushrooms with jasmine rice cream  crispy matsutake and foie gras ravioli  veal raviolis cooked in broth with white truffle. This was my favorite course(s). I found the white truffle that perfumed the air completely intoxicating. Each preparation was stellar  but the ravioli with the matsytake (japanese mushroom) and foie gras was the most tasty morsel of the night. Possibly the most tasty bite ever; definitely  in recent memory.  Roasted spiny lobster with green curry and fresh coriander. Collectively  we agreed this was the weakest dish of the evening. The lobster was tough and stringy. It looked beautiful  but it was far less satisfying upon digging in.  Caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy. This dish delivered big flavors in the best way. It was another favorite of the night. It had a delightfully unexpected  umami thing going on. Plus  it was sugar and spice and everything nice.  Duo of duck breast and foie gras  five spice sweet and sour grapes with ginger. On paper this course sounds the most to my liking  and don't get me wrong  it was outstanding  but the flavors were similar to those I've had before. I really appreciate when my tastebuds are tempted by something unexpected. That said  this was extremely comforting  especially paired with Joel Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes which we insist is actually potato infused butter.  Coconut lime parfait topped with elderflower liquer gelee and compressed pineapple. The pineapple was incredibly intense. It was so refreshing. It went beautifully with the dollop of cilantro syrup in the center of the plate.  Caramelized vanilla apples tarte tatin with calvados ice cream. The apples in this dessert must have been the same variety that Eve tempted Adam with  I've never had a juicier or more crisp bite of apple. If it is possible to taste a season in a bite  this accomplishes it - no doubt.  You would think we would be unable to consume another bite  but there was still the dessert cart. Calling it a cart  hardly does it justice. It's truly magical. It's hard to believe we showed restraint when choosing about two dozen selections  plus  tiramisu  rum balls and creme brulee.   It was the perfect end to a story book meal. We were incredibly fortunate to enjoy a restaurant of this caliber twice in one year. It is a real pleasure."
